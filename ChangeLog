	* Version 1.4.

	* README: some minor updates to reflect changes in the last 4
	years. :-)

	* readlzw.c (code_resync): fixed a possible hang with corrupt
	files.

	* Version 1.3.

	* main.c: now supports reading of self-extracting archives. (It
	doesn't support those produced with pkpak, but even pkunpak can't
	read those.)

	* main.c (arc_extract_or_test): added support for compression
	methods 5 and 6, which seem to be along the same lines as v1.0 of
	the CP/M `crunch' scheme. So I was able to adapt some code from
	lbrate. This isn't very well tested though - it works on the
	only test file I have.

	* main.c (read_file_header): added support for the Acorn
	Archimedes's variant "Spark" format (including the extra
	compression method), which is based on the more usual .arc. Any
	`subdirectories' are extracted as the .arc files they really are.

	* main.c: include unistd.h rather than getopt.h, which was
	troublesome on some systems. Thanks to Geoff Gibbs for
	pointing this out (I'm slightly annoyed that I didn't notice
	it myself, to be honest).

2002-04-15  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@ntlworld.com>

	* Version 1.2.

	* main.c: added `-p' option, to extract files to stdout.
	(Enabling this also moves some error-reporting from stdout to
	stderr.) Thanks to Hilko Bengen for reminding me about this
	one.

2001-08-30  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@ntlworld.com>

	* main.c (mkdatetimet): DST effects from the mktime() timestamp
	generation caused some file times to be off by an hour - now
	fixed.

2001-08-16  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@ntlworld.com>

	* Version 1.1.

	* Added `extracting multiple archives' section to man page, from
	lbrate.

2001-08-12  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@ntlworld.com>

	* main.c (usage_help): removed embedded LFs in string.

	* nomarch.1: added section on how to use nomarch with Emacs.

	* main.c: added `-U' option to use uppercase archive member
	filenames - or more precisely, to avoid lowercasing them. (In
	practice, almost all archives use uppercase member filenames.)

2001-08-08  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@ntlworld.com>

	* main.c (arc_extract_or_test): corrected typo in comment :-) (it
	does *atime* and mtime, not ctime/mtime!).

2001-08-04  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@ntlworld.com>

	* main.c (arc_extract_or_test): file-writing errors didn't
	previously cause a non-zero exit value - they do now.

2001-08-03  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@ntlworld.com>

	* main.c (read_file_data): fixed memory leak when not all of an
	archive file member could be read.

2001-07-30  Russell Marks  <russell.marks@ntlworld.com>

	* Version 1.0.
