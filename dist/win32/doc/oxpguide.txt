        --------------------------- Preface ---------------------------

        This guide has been written as an aid to getting you started
        with OpenXP. The intentions are to get you as far as making
        your first poll to your Boss, sending an AreaFix request and
        then processing the resultant list. In no way is it intended
        as a tutorial in the use of OpenXP. This document relates to
        the OpenXP versions 3.8.xx and 3.9.xx only.

        distribution archives.

        ---------------------------------------------------------------

        Before commencing the OpenXP installation, you MUST obtain
        the following information from your Boss .....

        1. Your Point number.
        2. Which archiver to use.
        3. Your Boss's online hours.
        4. Your session password.
        5. Does your Boss's mailer support EMSI.
        6. Does your Boss's mailer support FTS-0006.
        7. Does your Boss use 4-D or 3-D addressing.
        8. What name(s) does his AreaFix programme respond to.
        9. What name(s) does his AllFix programme respond to.

        ---------------------------------------------------------------
        IMPORTANT NOTE: In the unlikely event that your Boss's mailer
        neither supports EMSI nor FTS-0006, you will NOT be able to
        poll him with OpenXP! In this event, then there's no point in
        going any further than here :-((
        ---------------------------------------------------------------

        BASIC FidoNet Point Installation(4D)
        ====================================

         1. Preliminary work.
         --------------------

          1.1 Extract the contents of the OpenXP archive into a
              directory of your choice (suggest "OPENXP"). Please
              note: the archive contains three directories; DOC,
              SAMPLES and BEISPIEL, so the relevant archiver switch
              must be used to extract these directories. In the case
              of PKUNZIP, the relevant switch is "-d".

          1.2 Next, either copy or move the contents of the SAMPLES
              directory into your OpenXP HOME directory. These
              are sample message templates and scripts which may
              be edited later to suit your own taste. The BEISPIEL
              directory can be ignored as this contains German
              templates and scripts.

          1.3 Now start OpenXP by typing OPENXP.EXE and when prompted
              for the language, type "E" and then press <Enter>.
              Please note: the default language is German and so if
              you press <Enter> without pressing "E" first, everything
              will be in German!

         2. Basic Configuration.
         -----------------------


          =============================================================
          *** ONLINE HELP IS AVAILABLE AT ANY TIME BY PRESSING <F1> ***
          =============================================================


          N.B. To move between fields either press <tab>, <up-arrow>
               or <down-arrow>. To "check" a box, press the <spacebar>

          2.1 You should now have a box in the middle of the screen
              which requires you to input information in three fields:

              "Type of net" -------> Press F2 and cursor down to "Fido"
                                     and press <Enter>

              "Server name" -------> Enter the node number of your BOSS
                                     and then press <Enter>
                                     (e.g. 2:250/333)

              "User name" ---------> Enter your OWN name and then press
                                     <Enter>
                                     (e.g. Joe Bloggs)

          2.2 You should now be presented with a more or less blank
              screen. Along the top of the screen you will notice a menu
              bar with eight options. For a basic configuration, some
              but not all of these options need to be configured. Look
              at the menu bar across the top of the screen, either
              select "Config" and press <Enter> or press "C". Now
              either select "Modem" and press <Enter> or press "M".
              Select the comport that your modem is connected to
              (e.g COM2) and press <Enter>. A box should now appear
              in the middle of the screen.

              "Use FOSSIL driver" -----> Leave this blank.

              "Port address (hex)" ----> If you are using standard
                                         comport addressing, leave this
                                         as it is. If you are NOT using
                                         standard comport addressing,
                                         enter the comport address here

              "IRQ number" ------------> If you are using standard
                                         comport addressing, leave this
                                         as it is. If you are NOT using
                                         standard comport addressing,
                                         enter the IRQ number here.

              "Modem init" ------------> Enter your modem init string
                                         here. (e.g AT&F&C1&D2)

              "Modem exit" ------------> Enter the string you would
                                         like OpenXP to send to the
                                         modem when you exit from the
                                         programme. Usually this would
                                         be ATZ

              "Dial comm." ------------> Press F2 and select ATDT

              "German Telekomm
               commemorative minute" --> Leave this blank.

              "Ignore CD" -------------> Leave this blank.

              "Ignore CTS" ------------> Leave this blank.

              "Use RTS" ---------------> Check this box.

              "Detect RING" -----------> Leave this blank.

              "16550 FIFO" ------------> In some instances, OpenXP
                                         will automatically detect the
                                         presence of a 16550 UART and
                                         place an "X" in this box.
                                         However, if you know that you
                                         have a 16550 UART and
                                         OpenXP doesn't detect it,
                                         you will have to check this box
                                         yourself. If you don't have a
                                         16550 UART, leave this box
                                         blank.

              "trigger level" ---------> This only applies if you have
                                         a 16550 UART and the default
                                         is 8. If you need to change
                                         this, press F2 and select the
                                         desired value.

          2.3 Now press <Enter> to save your settings and return to
              the main screen.


          2.4 The next option that needs to be configured is "Edit".
              Press "d". A pull-down menu should now appear. Either
              cursor down to "Servers" and press <Enter> or press "S".
              You should now have a large box in the middle of your
              screen. At the bottom of the box there are six options.
              Either cursor along to "Edit" and press <Enter> or press
              "E". You should now see a pull-down menu with seven
              options. The menu bar should be over "Point". Now press
              <Enter> and another box should appear on your screen.
              This box contains several input fields. To move between
              the fields either press <tab> or <down arrow>:

          2.5 "Point number" ----------> Enter your Point number (e.g. 1)

              "Point net" -------------> Leave this as it is (20000)

              "Phone" -----------------> Enter the phone number of your
                                         BOSS (e.g. 01274484076)

              "Passwd" ----------------> Enter your session password

              "Upload packer" ---------> Press F2 and a pick-list will
                                         appear. By pressing <down arrow>
                                         you can select which archiver
                                         you want to use for your
                                         outgoing mail packets. Once the
                                         menu-bar is over the archiver
                                         you want to use, press <Enter>.

              "Download unpacker ------> Exactly the same procedure as
                                         for "Upload packer", except
                                         with this option, you choose
                                         which archiver to use for
                                         incoming mail packets. Ideally,
                                         it should be the same one as
                                         your upload packer.

              "Zmodem options" --------> Leave blank.

              "AKA's" -----------------> Leave blank.

              "Send packets for" ------> Leave blank.

              "4D addresses" ----------> If your Boss uses 4-D
                                         addressing, you need to check
                                         this box. If your Boss uses 3-D
                                         addressing, this box needs to
                                         be empty.

              "TosScan" ---------------> Leave this box empty.

              "EMSI" ------------------> If your Boss's mailer supports
                                         EMSI, check this box. If it
                                         doesn't, leave it empty.

              "Set system clock" ------> Leave empty.

              "Packet password" -------> If you have agreed a packet
                                         password with your Boss, check
                                         this box. If you haven't, leave
                                         it empty.

              "Use node address" ------> Leave empty.

              "Send empty packet" -----> Some mailers need to receive
                                         something before they will send
                                         anything. Check with your Boss
                                         to see if his is one of this
                                         type of mailer. If it is, you
                                         need to check this box. If it
                                         isn't, leave it empty. In most
                                         cases, leave this box empty.
                                         If your Boss is using T-Mail,
                                         this box needs to be checked.

              "Ext. packet names" -----> Check this box but it would be
                                         advisable to ask your Boss if
                                         his mail processing software
                                         supports this feature.

          2.6 Now press <enter> to save your settings and return to the
              previous screen.

          2.7 Make sure that "Edit" is highlighted and then press
              <Enter>. Cursor down to "Modem" and press <Enter>.

              "Wait for connection" ---> This should be set to a minimum
                                         of 50

              " Dial pause" -----------> This is the time (in seconds)
                                         that you want OpenXP to
                                         wait between dialling attempts
                                         (e.g 60)

              "max.dialling attempts" -> Set this to the number of
                                         attempts that you want
                                         OpenXP to re-dial after
                                         receiving either a "BUSY" or a
                                         "NO CARRIER" message (e.g 10)

              "max.connects" ----------> This should be set to the
                                         number of times you want
                                         OpenXP to re-call your BOSS
                                         following a failed session. It
                                         is advisable to set this to 2

              "min. cps rate" ---------> This is the minimum CPS rate at
                                         which you will allow OpenXP
                                         to transfer mail/files to/from
                                         your Boss. If the CPS rate
                                         drops below the figure that you
                                         enter here, OpenXP will
                                         disconnect from your Boss. It's
                                         entirely a matter for you to
                                         decide what to enter here. A
                                         suggested figure for a 14400
                                         modem would be 1200. A
                                         suggested figure for a 28800
                                         modem would be 2500. However,
                                         if you enter "0" here,
                                         OpenXP will allow the CPS
                                         rate to fall indefinitely.

              "Modem init." -----------> If you do NOT wish to use the
                                         default init string, you can
                                         enter a different one here. If
                                         you DO want to use the default
                                         init string, leave this field
                                         empty.

              "Interface" -------------> Press "F2" and select the
                                         comport to use.

              "Speed" -----------------> Press "F2" and select the
                                         baudrate.

          2.8 Now press <Enter> to save your settings and return to the
              previous screen.

          2.9 Make sure that "Edit" is highlighted and then press
              <Enter>. Cursor down to "Names" and press <Enter>.

              "Node number" -----------> Your BOSS's node number should
                                         already be in this box. If it
                                         isn't, enter it here.

              "User name" -------------> Your OWN name should already be
                                         in this box. If it isn't, enter
                                         it here.

              "Origin" ----------------> Enter your origin line here
                                         (e.g "My Point")

              "Comment" ---------------> You can enter anything you like
                                         in here! It is usual to enter
                                         the name of your Boss's system.

              "Domain" ----------------> Press "F2" and select
                                         "fidonet".

          2.10 Now press <Enter> to save your settings and return to the
               previous screen.

          2.11 Make sure that "Edit" is highlighted and then press
               <Enter>. Cursor down to "Fido" and press <Enter>.

              "AreaFix (Name)" --------> Press "F2" and select "Areafix"

              "AreaFix (Password)" ----> Enter your areafix password
                                         here. This is usually the same
                                         as your session password but
                                         you will need to verify this
                                         with your Boss.

              ""+" for area requests" -> Normally this can be left blank
                                         but consult your Boss to be
                                         absolutely sure.

              "Commands as subject" ---> Check this box.

              "d'Bridge areafix" ------> If your Boss is using the
                                         D'Bridge mailer, check this
                                         box. If he isn't, leave it
                                         blank.

              "FileScan (Name)" -------> Press "F2" and select "AllFix"

              "FileScan (Password)" ---> Enter your AllFix password
                                         here. This is usually the same
                                         as your session password but
                                         you will need to verify this
                                         with your Boss.

              "Misc. Newsgroups" ------> Press "F2" and select "/FIDO/"

          2.12 Now press <Enter> to save your settings and return to
               the previous screen.

          2.13 Make sure that "Edit" is highlighted and then press
               <Enter>. Cursor down to "Misc." and press <Enter>.
               If your Boss is NOT online 24 hours, you need to configure
               "Netcall". Example: if your Boss is online from 22:00 to
               06:00, you would need to do this:

               "Netcall" ------> Exclude from 06:00 to 22:00
                                times

              If your Boss IS online 24 hours, you need do nothing with
              the above option.

              "Misc (/Netcall/All)" ---> This box needs to be checked.

          2.14 Now press <Enter> to save your settings and return to
               the previous screen.

          2.15 Now select "OK" and press <Enter> to take you back to
               the main screen.

          2.16 The BASIC installation is now complete.

         3. Notes.
         ---------

          3.1  An areas list is NOT required prior to polling your Boss
               for the first time but just for the sake of completeness,
               full instructions for obtaining an areas list are
               provided in section 4.

          3.2  It is NOT necessary to manually configure echo areas
               prior to polling your Boss for the first time.

          3.3  A nodelist is NOT required for a BASIC FidoNet Point
               Installation.

          3.4  The OpenXP main archives are available  on the
               internet at:
                           http://www.openxp.com
                           ftp://ftp.openxp.de/openxp

          3.5  English language support for OpenXP is available in the
               FidoNet international echo XPOINT. At the time of writing,
               the echo is on the Z1B and the Z2-R25 and Z2-R24 backbones.
               English language support may also be sought in the German
               newsgroup "de.comm.software.crosspoint". Articles in English
               ARE allowed in this newsgroup.

         4. Requesting and processing an areas list.
         -------------------------------------------

          4.1  From OpenXP's main screen, select "Message". From the
               menu that has now appeared, select "News manager". From
               the sub-menu select "Get list" and press <Enter>.
               OpenXP will now generate an areafix request. If you
               wish to view the areafix request prior to sending it to
               your Boss, select "Message/Unsent/show" and press
               <Enter>. The message header information should now be
               displayed. To view the message itself, press <Enter>.
               When you have looked at the areafix message, press <ESC>,
               <ESC>, to bring you back to the main screen.

          4.2  And now for the big moment - sending the areafix request
               to your Boss. First make sure your modem is switched on
               and then from the main screen, press "N", then press
               "S" - it's as simple as that! Now sit back and watch it
               all happen :-)

          4.3  Assuming that all went well with the poll, you must now
               poll your Boss again to pickup the areas list. Depending
               on how your Boss has his system set up will determine how
               long to wait before calling back. Most Bosses process
               areafix requests 'on the spot'. It's entirely a matter for
               you to decide how long to wait before attempting to pickup
               the areas list but I would suggest waiting at least five
               minutes. To pickup the list, press "N" followed by "S"
               from the main screen and OpenXP will call your Boss
               to pickup the waiting areas list.

          4.4  You should now have two folders displayed on your main
               screen. One of the folders should be named "/ØNetcall",
               which contains extracts from the logfile and the other
               should be marked "/<yourname>", which is your incoming
               netmail folder. To process the areas list, cursor over
               the folder named "/<yourname>" and press <Enter>.
               Assuming that the only item in this folder is the areas
               list, now select "Message/News manager/Import list" and
               press <Enter>. If there is more than the areas list in
               this folder, you need to cursor over the areas list prior
               to selecting "Message/News manager/Import list".
               OpenXP will now read the areas list and import it
               into its database. To view the areas list, cursor over
               the areas list and press <Enter>.

          4.5  To fix-in(subscribe) to an area(s), select "Message/News
               manager/Subscribe" and press <Enter>. The areas list
               will now be displayed. To fix into areas it's a simple
               matter of cursoring over the area(s) and pressing the
               <spacebar>. When you have finished, press <Enter> and
               you will be asked to confirm your choice(s). It's a
               simple "Yes/No" reply. Assuming that you answered yes,
               OpenXP will generate the areafix request. To send the
               request, get back to the main screen and press "N"
               followed by "S".

=========================================================================


        Basic/Desirable tweaks 'n twiddles
        ==================================
         Once the first three polls have been successfully made, a few
         tweaks need to be done before polling your Boss again.
         Although not mandatory, they could be considered desirable ...

         1. From the menu bar across the top of OpenXP's main
            screen, select "Config". From the drop down menu, select
            "Options" and from that drop down menu, select "Messages".
            Cursor down to "Use Re^n", un-check the box and press
            <Enter>. The cursor should now be in  the "Time Zone" box.
            Enter here your Time Zone, in the form "W+x" or "W-x",
            where "+x" equals the number of hours ahead of UTC and
            where "-x" equals the number of hours behind UTC. Now press
            <Enter>. The cursor should now be in the "## XP ##" box.
            Press F2, cursor down to "never" and press <Enter>. Check
            the next box and press <Enter> and then press <Enter> on
            the remaining options.

         2. From the menu bar across the top of OpenXP's main
            screen, select "Edit". From the drop down menu, select
            "Groups". Cursor down to "Netz" and press "E". Now cursor
            down to "Replies" and press F2. Cursor down to "none" and
            press <Enter>, <Enter>. Press "O" to save the new
            setting.

         3. From the menu bar across the top of OpenXP's main
            screen, select "Config". From the drop down menu, select
            "Options" and from that drop down menu, select "Netcall".
            Cursor down to "Complete netcall logfile (NETCALL.LOG)" and
            check the box. Now press <Enter>, <Enter> to save the new
            setting.

         4. From the menu bar across the top of OpenXP's main
            screen, select "Config". from the drop down menu, select
            "Options" and from that drop down menu, select "Addresses".
            In the "Organization" field, enter your system name e.g.
            "My Point" - without the quotes. Now press <Enter> and
            in the "Postal address" field, write your City/Town. Leave
            all other fields blank.

         5. Before writing any messages, it would be advisable to
            configure your "signature" and "greetings" templates. By
            doing this, you will be saving yourself a lot of
            unnecessary typing. To configure these templates, select
            "Edit" from the menu bar across the top of OpenXP's
            main screen and from the drop down menu, select
            "Templates". For your netmail signature, cursor down to
            "PrIvSignature" and press <Enter>. This will place you in
            the OpenXP editor where you may define your netmail
            signature. Once you are happy with your signature, press
            <ESC> and answer "Yes" to the question. Now cursor up to
            "Signature" and press <Enter> to get back into the editor,
            where you may now define your echomail signature. Repeat
            the "<ESC>, "Yes" process to save your echomail signature.
            Now cursor up to "PrivHead" and press <Enter> to get back
            into the editor where you may now define your netmail
            "greeting". This could be something like "Hi $VORNAME" or
            "Hello $VORNAME" - without the quotes. $VORNAME will
            translate to the first name of the person you are writing
            to but only for new netmail messages. For netmail replies,
            see "PrivQuote". Now repeat the "<ESC>", "Yes" process to
            save your netmail greeting. Now cursor up to "Head" and
            press <Enter> to get back into the editor where you may
            now define your echomail "greeting". This could be
            something like "Hello All" or "Hi" - without the quotes.
            Now repeat the "<ESC>", "Yes" process to save your echomail
            greeting. A full explanation on the use and configuration
            of templates can be found in "TEMPLATE.HTO" which is
            available for file request from 2:250/333. For further help
            with OpenXP, link into the FidoNet echo XPOINT.

            Have Fun! :-)

========================================================================

Command line switches for starting CrossPoint
=============================================

CrossPoint is started with:

              XP [/Option1 /Option2 ...]

Options are:

   /?         Help

   /av:       Runs the integrated archive viewer.
              eg. XP /av:file.zip. Wildcards allowed.

   /f:<File>  loads a EGA/VGA-Font File (Screen Font)
              in the usual formats (8x8, 8x16 Pixels)
              If no extension is given, .FNT assumed.

   /gd:       selects another phone charge file (Default:
              GEBUEHR.DAT).

   /j         no dumb remark when exiting CrossPoint....

   /k:X       passes the (single) keystroke X to the
              programme, where X is any character.
              (Can start a key macro on start-up)

   /l:X       selects the language, eg. /l:E for English.
              Of course, the language module must be installed.

   /LCD       changes colours to improve screen visibility
              on laptops etc.
              see also /m below.

   /m         forces a black & white display.

   /maus      activates a Cursor-Mouse emulation.

   /pw:xxx    passes the start-up password direct.

   /q         deactivates all sounds, so as not to
              wake you at night..

   /rp        Do not check TSRs
              CrossPoint normally checks after a
              DOS-Shell whether TSRs were loaded and
              exits if yes. (It is rarely advisable to
              load TSRs in a shell). However, if you must,
              this switch stops the check.

   /sd        Do not flush Smartdrive;
              Normally XP flushes the smartdrive write
              cache (if active) at regular intervals to
              minimise data loss possibilities. This
              deactivates this flushing if you don't like
              it.

   /trace     activates netcall script logging.

   /w         Give up CPU time under Windows. To lower the
              load on the CPU when XP is idle, the screen
              saver, clock and mouse emulation is
              switched off.

   /z:x       Set x screen lines. x must be one of the
              values shown under /Config/Display/Lines.

For the following options, if you set more than one,
they are carried out in the order shown here.
/ip & /ips may not be specified simultaneously.
In this case the LAST given is run.


   /autostart:hhmm-hhmm  Starts CrossPoint if the
              current time is in the given time period.
              This entry is designed for the autoexec.bat
              file and starting the PC with a time switch.
              If the time at start is in the given period,
              XP starts up.

   /user:BOX:NAME  sets the User name for the given
              Box. For multi-user points.
              For Fido use "_" instead of ":" in
              the Box name.

   /ip:FILE   Imports the specified file name as
              puffer, as under (/XPoint/Import
              /Puffer). The filename may be a full
              path; the file must have a PUFFER
              format.

   /ipe:FILE  as /ip, but sets the receive date for
              messages to the date they were
              written.

   /ips:BOX:FILE  reads in the puffer FILE, and also
              lays it up ready to send to BOX.
              For Fido use "_" instead of ":" in
              the box name.

   /g         is an extra switch for /ip and /ipe, which
              sets the imported messages direct to "already
              read". Not necessary for /ips

   /n:BOX[:hh:mm]  starts CrossPoint making a call to
              the given box. If the time is
              specified, it waits to make a
              netcall at the given time.
              For Fido use "_" instead of ":" in
              the box name.

   /n:*       starts CrossPoint to make a  /Netcall/All.

   /nr:BOX    makes a relogin netcall at the given box.
              The connect must already exist, and the
              box be waiting for "Username".
              (Z-Netz only)

   /t:n       starts CrossPoint running Timing List
              no. "n"

   /r         does a Re-Org/Messages

   /pack      does a Re-Org/Pack

   /xpack     only pack files whose use lies under 100%
              A file name may be specified,
              eg. /xpack:USER packs only the User File.

   /ss        start screensaver

   /x         End Program. Since it is carried out last, it
              is used to end the program after other tasks
              have been carried out by other parameters,

Diagnostics Options:

   /d         debug mode; displays more information during
              the progress of a netcall.

   /df:1      shows the command call when an external
              program is called (icl. parameters).

   /df:2      waits for a key to be pressed after an
              external program call.

1. Writing/Sending Messages
===========================

Q1.1 I have a NetMail from my Boss in my personal area. What is the
     preferred method of repling to messages that are in there.

A1.1 If you want to quote the original message, press "Ctl-P"
     If you don't want to quote the original message, press "P"

     *****

Q1.2 How do I initiate a NetMail to someone.

A1.2 Goto "Message/Direct" and press <return>. A box will appear in the
     middle of the screen with a "To" field and a "Subject" field.
     Methinks that this is self-explanatory<g>. However, the "To" field
     is rather natty and deserves further explanation. You can either
     enter a name, a part-name or a node number and *providing* you have
     a nodelist installed, XP will do a nodelist lookup for you. If you
     enter a part-name, XP will popup all the matches it finds in the
     nodelist and then it's up-to-you to select the correct one. Neat or
     what? :-))

     One thing I should mention at this point is, that if you have more
     than one Server(Boss) set up, you will get an additional field in
     the box where you can define which Server to send the netmail via.

     *****

Q1.3 How would one send a NetMail direct to a Point's BossNode with the
     intention that the Netmail should be passed to the Point?

A1.3 Goto "Message/Direct" and enter the Point's name as the recipient.
     If the recipient is in your address book, XP will find him and tag
     his address on the end of his name. If he isn't in your addrees book
     you would need to enter the details manually like so .....
     "Geoff Bent@2:250/333.7". Then proceed as normal with your message.
     When you come to save the message and you get the *big* box on the
     screen with the numerous options at the bottom, select "Special" and
     then select "Crash". XP will then ask you if you want to send the
     message now or later. If you elect to send it now, XP will call
     2:250/333 but the message will still be addressed to 2:250/333.7
     The same applies if you elect to send the message later.

     *****

Q1.4 I want to import a text file into a message. I might be able to use
     that F10 drop-down menu, but I haven't found out how to do that yet.

A1.4 The way that the F10 menu is worded, it tends to give the idea that
     it's a 3 key, all at the same time, command. It isn't, it's the same
     as many other Text Editors - the use of an old WordStar command. When
     you press CTRL+K by itself, you'll notice a  ^K  appear up on the
     top left of your screen, it's then "waiting" for you to bang the
     other key, which for import/read is the R key. You should then get
     a wildcard choice, which you can accept, or you can just type in
     the Path/Name of the text file you want to import.

     *****

Q1.5 I can reply to the "From:" writers. How do I reply to the "To:"
     adresses and quote parts of the message at the same time?

A1.5 Whilst you have a list of messages displayed, cursor over the one
     you wish to reply to and press Ctl-Q.

     *****

Q1.6 How *do* you do that; reply to a message in another area I mean?

A1.6 That's where the "Message/Forward" routine comes into play. But
     before you try it, you need to have the relevant template set up
     correctly.

     Goto "Edit/Templates/QuoteTo" and edit the template accordingly.
     Here's mine for you to have a look at .....
     === Cut ===
     - Hello $VORNAME -

     ** Replying to a post in "$BRETT" **

     $ERSTELLT, $MUSER rattled off a missive entitled "$BETREFF":
     === Cut ===

     Once you've adapted yours to suit and chosen a message to reply to,
     goto the 'dreaded' "Message/Forward" thing and select "QuoteTo".
     XP will ask you if you want to reply in a newsgroup, to a user or
     direct. Select whichever one suits the occasion and away ya go :-)

     *****

Q1.7 I'm replying to a message by pressing the letter R and am using
     Xpoint's internal editor to do so. However, I'd like to be able to
     see the message whilst I'm inserting my comments, so I'm clearly
     pressing the wrong button. Can you clarify which button does what
     when I have a message on screen and I wish to reply please.

A1.7 CTRL+R is what you're looking for, which gives you the quoted reply
     format. R, as you've found, just gives you the non-quote response.
     However, if you want to send the reply as a netmail - you've got
     CTRL+P or P at your disposal.

     With some messages, you'll find that you'll need the F4 key to bring
     the odd long line back into a decent format. The CTRL+K, then R
     routine is, as with a fair number of other editors, handy for
     importing other text into your message.

     *****

Q1.8 What happens when I press the Esc key to save a message?

A1.8 The use of the ESC key seems to be almost a "standard" with some
     (most ?) of these German progs, and they then also seem to give a
     "do you want to change your mind" screen or choice next. That
     secondary screen that appears does seem a bit overdone at first, but
     it defaults to the "Send" so you only need to hit the Return/Enter
     key as soon as you see the screen. Later, after maybe a bit of
     experimentation - or wondering how you can twiddle summat at about
     the stage you want to send the message, some of those choices on that
     secondary screen can come in useful.

     *****

Q1.9 I don't know/cannot see what the "F3" key does.

A1.9 In the message editor, F3 turns word-wrap OFF

     *****

Q1.10 I don't know/cannot see what CTL-R does

A1.10 Quote-reply - echomail ONLY

      *****

Q1.11 What happens if I press "W"

A1.11 It depends on which "menu screen" you're in.

      On that first screen that XP defaults to, using the W when cursored
      over a folder produces an Echomail message.
      If you've used the TAB key to get to the second screen and are showing
      your active outgoing netmail folders, then the W will start you orft
      writing a Private netmail message.

      _But_ - the above is only true provided that you've _not_ activated
      that (S)pecial option. When that's been invoked - W then means
      "manually set up a new Folder".

      *****

Q1.12 How do I initiate a message in NetMail?

A1.12 a) Use the main menu choice.  Message==>Direct. Then follow the
      choices etc. or

      b) Assuming that you've already sent netmail to someone, an outgoing
      netmail (Private Mail, or PM, in XPoint's terms) folder has been
      automatically generated.

      To access this outgoing netmail folders screen, press your TAB key and
      you'll see another screen somewhat similar to your "Echomail" screen,
      but in the following format:-

        XPoint  Re-Org  Message  Netcall  Fido  Edit  Config  Tools
        All  Write  Textfile  Binary  Special  Seek  Address-book  PW
      ---------------------------------------------------------------
      -    ALLFIX@2:250/333
      -    Anders Danielsson@2:203/620
      -    AreaFix@2:13840/0
      -    Areafix@2:250/333
      -    Chris Horn@2:241/505.4
      -    Dave Rosendale@2:250/355.1
      -    Dave Rosendale@2:250/377
      -    David Pratt@2:250/355
      -    Geoff Bent@2:250/333.7
      -    Michael Kirst@1:3633/36
      ============================ Cut ==================

      Each one of those entries with ye tick in front of them, is an outgoing
      netmail folder. Which you can use in a similar manner to those Echomail
      folders. To initiate a new message to one of them, same applies as the
      Echomail idea, cursor over the name/address you're interested in and
      press W.

      Now - here's a handy thing :)  Note that on that 2nd menu line there's
      a Binary choice. Binary = programs/archives.  Now, if you want to send
      someone such a file, it's a case of cursoring over the name/address -
      then select "I" undt voila, you can then select the file you want to
      send - complete with a little message.  2nd Note: that bInary choice
      is also available on your Echomail screen, but that action could be
      curtailed at the Boss end - so ain't, as you'd guess, particularly
      recommended in some situations.

      *****

Q1.13 How do I change the flavour of a netmail (e.g. Normal to Crash)

A1.13 Now hereby can hang a longish tale .....

      The default of XPoint is to route all netmail through your Boss.
      So, generally, until you instruct it otherwise _and_ have a Nodelist
      added, you can't send a Crash flavoured netmail.

      Thus, I'm interpreting your question to read "How to change from its
      Normal flavour to Crash flavour so that it can be sent directly to
      the Node or Boss of a Point"....... in which case, that's where that
      secondary screen comes into operation when you've written a Netmail
      and used the ESC key and accepted the "OK to save" little message.
      Up then pops that secondary screen, along the bottom of which - are a
      number of "button" appearance selections. One of them is "Special".
      Selecting that choice, brings up yet another sub-screen where you can
      select "Crash" - which then bungs you back to the previous screen
      where you can select the Send choice.

      At this point - you, depending in some cases as to whereabouts in a
      folder you are, will then get another small screen asking you if you
      wish to start the Crash call now or not. Selecting the Now choice,
      XPoint immediately starts calling out.

      If you've told it NOT to do the immediate Crash call, then the message
      is saved but is tagged by XPoint as being of Crash status and will
      send that message if/when you decide to call that Node for some reason.
      Or.....>

      Having opted for the "not now" attribute, later on you can then send
      the Crash mail by using the main menu choice of Fido===>Crash. If
      you've only the one place to Crash mail to, then that'll go. If you've
      saved a few different Crash messages addressed to different systems,
      you're then offered a sub-screen where you can select the
      address/message to send.

      And there's another choice - which you'll possibly get to later :))

      *****

Q1.14 I have (inadvertently, because I'd forgotten the P/R association)
      sent two netmail messages into an echo. The query is: How do I change
      echomail to netmail and vice versa?

A1.14 Strictly speaking, this is not possible. However, an echomail message
      can be copied into netmail and vice versa .....

      a) Netmail=>Echomail. Main menu, Message==>Forward_To===>(choice),
      where (choice) is best perhaps the "Edit To" selection, unless you
      prefer the "Quote To" choice. You'll get a choice come up as to
      whether you want to Forward (Copy To, whatever) the message to a
      "Newsgroup" or "User". Newsgroup=Echo, User=Netmail. Select
      "Newsgroup" and a list of newsgroups will then be displayed. Cursor
      over the newsgroup to copy to and press <return>. The message will be
      copied to that area and you will then be taken to the editor so that
      you can make any desired changes. To save the copy, just go through
      the normal "save" procedure.

      b) Echomail=>Netmail. Go through the same procedure as in "a)" but
      select either "User" or "Direct" instead of "Newsgroup". If you
      select "User", then the person's name/address must already exist in
      the secondary outgoing Private Mail screen. If you select "Direct",
      then you need to enter either a name, part-name or node number in the
      box which has now appeared.

Q1.16 Can I Fattach? In echomail?

A1.16 XPoint won't allow you to send a File Attach with an Echomail message.
      Although, according to that second line hotkey menu in the echomail
      folder screen, it's apparently available - if you try it, you'll get
      a message telling you that it's a no-go in a Fido type area. I've got
      to assume that the choice is there (Binary or Textfile) for other
      types of nets and/or Internet useage.

      But this should work :)
      TAB to the Netmail folder screen.
      Cursor over the particular name/address that you want to send the file
      to.
      Select the B(i)nary choice from that second line.
      You'll then be presented with XP's "picklist" screen, once you've
      either selected that *.* wildcard choice or told it to use a different
      Path for its search.
      Cursor over the file to be sent.  Press Enter/Return.
      You'll then be invited to write a netmail message as soon as you've
      done that - because XP slaps you straight into the message editor.
      You've got to produce your own "Hi xxxxx," and "TaTa" lines, it's also
      advisable to add a "dummy" tearline of 3 dashes on the line following
      your signature (just-in-case).

2. Reading messages

Q2.1 What can I do with Ctrl-A and Ctrl-E whilst reading messages?

A2.1 Ctl-A marks every line and Ctl-E un-marks every line.

     *****

Q2.2 How do I show the message kludges?

A2.2 Ah! .. this is a little tricky.
     TTBOMK, there are two ways of doing this but because of the complexity
     of one of them, I'll advise on the easy one for now <coff> :-)

     You need to have a list of messages in front of you. Cursor over the
     desired message and press "I" und voila, a pretty box should appear
     with all sorts of info for your perusal :-))

     *****

Q2.3 What is the command to export a message to the printer or to a text
     file please?

A2.3 Whilst reading a message, press "W" to export the message to a text
     file or press "D" to export it to the printer.

     *****

Q2.4 I cannot see how to use the marked items or marked block, I suppose
     that this means they can be cut out and pasted elsewhere (with the
     F10 menu?)

A2.4 Errm, nope :)

     F7 - mark start of block
     F8 - mark end of block

     Ctl-KC - copy block to cursor position
     Ctl-KV - move block to cursor position
     Ctl-KY - delete block
     Ctl-KW - write block to file
     Ctl-KO - ROT13 encrypt block
     Ctl-QB - move cursor to beginning of block
     Ctl-QK - move cursor to end of block

     *****

Q2.5 Backspace - I don't know/cannot see what it does

A2.5 This one's a bit subtle .....
     Whilst reading a message, if you press <ESC>, you are taken back to
     the list of messages and the highlight bar is advanced to the next
     message. If, however, you were to press <backspace> instead of <ESC>,
     you would still be taken back to the list of messages but the
     highlight bar would remain on the message you've just read.

     *****

Q2.6 How do you read other flavours (than ZIP) for a Fattach?
     What if the Fattach is ARJ'd, LHA'd or RAR'd or one of the more
     obscure compressors?

A2.6 Ah!  Sounds as though you might have missed that little gem tucked
     away in XP's automagic config part ;)

     Have a look in that XPOINT.CFG file, methinks you'll find XP has
     already found all the archivers you've got available in your main
     Path :)

     If you use the menu selection of Config==>External and then select the
     Unpacker choice offered. You'll notice that there's quite a range of
     Archivers listed, which XP "sniffs out" to see if you've got them in
     your Path - and bungs a tick mark on the right hand side of the screen
     if it can find them. There's, normally, no need to alter any of those
     bits. Quite a crafty little sniffing job that it does.

     *****

Q2.7 Not quite a query-more of the look what I've found thingie:-
     In the message reader with the individual messages screened and one
     highlighted, if I press the [Backspace] key the message appears in a
     Hex format. Isn't that clever? But is it any use?

A2.7 I can't imagine what that could be used for but someone may have a
     use for it :-)

     *****

Q2.8 How do you produce that ladder diagram of messages responses?

A2.8 Have you tried the "trick" of using the # key when cursored over a
     message ?? If not, then try it when cursored over this one. You'll
     need a fair number of messages in the Folder to demonstrate its
     usefulness though.

     *****

Q2.9 Is it possible to export this ladder diagram to a File or printer or
     to include it within another message please?

A2.9 Use the ALT+I routine. One minor problem though - if there's a long
     thread, you've got to do individual screen dumps and then "marry" them
     together.

     *****

Q2.10 How can I extract parts of messages when using the Reader/Lister?

A2.10 Tap the M key, and you should get a cursor bar, or line-highlight bar,
      showing at or near the top of the screen.

      You'll possibly discover that use of the up and down cursor keys will
      move it. But the use of the left and right cursor keys will "kill" it.

      Now, while that bar's showing, press the space-bar a few times and you
      should observe that some of the lines have changed colour.
      The space-bar toggles the line colouring so you can cancel the marking
      of unwanted parts.

      If you now tap the W key, you can now write those lines out to a text
      file of your choice........ This could be useful perhaps ?

      If you tap the "D" key it might also allow you to print just those
      lines instead of the whole message.

      *****

Q2.11 Is there a Search function?

A2.11 If you're using the Reader/Lister by means of the "Archive Viewer"
      choice - where you're attempting to read some lengthy documentation
      file is to use the S key to call up the Search feature. When you use
      that S key, a Search command line appears at the bottom of the screen
      - you just type in the text that you want to search for, press
      Enter/Return and away it trundles. To repeat the search, use the
      TAB key.

      *****

Q2.12 Can you search more than just one message?

A2.12 Try the Message==>Search routine, either globally or in an individual
      message area ?  Spacebar will get rid of the "marked flag".

      After Note: Crumbs! That's powerful. I searched for "Motherboard"
      which (from my very limited message base) gave me three different
      echos in which there were messages that had that expression in the
      text!

3. Nodelist Support
===================

Q3.1 Please remind me how I get the Region25 Nodelist operative with Xpoint

A3.1 Main menu, Fido=>>Nodelist==>Configure.  Preferably have the Nodelist/s
     that are needed already tucked away into XP's /FIDO sub-directory.

     Snapshot coming up .....

     I realise that this doesn't exactly answer your question but I'm sure
     there will be a more comprehensive reply shortly.

Q3.2 How do I look up a particular address?

A3.2 Alt-N

     *****


4. Address Book
===============

Q4.1 Now I've discovered that if I press the Tab key, I can find a huge
     list of addresses (the majority of which I'll rarely want to use) is
     there a convenient way of deleting those that I don't want please?

A4.1 If none of those addresses have a little "v" by the side of them,
     then they're addresses that aren't "active" in your outgoing netmail
     AddressBook. Try just pressing the (A)ll hotkey and you _should_ be
     left with just the Active addresses showing.

     That's one of the ways to either activate an address and get its own
     outgoing netmail folder slot going, or to de-activate an address you
     no longer need a folder for. The other main ways of getting one of
     those folders activated is just to use that Message==>Direct routine,
     or use an ALT+P(or P) when replying to a message.

     *****

Q4.2 I have discovered if, with the list on screen I press b for the
     Address- Book, I get a little tick against a name and if I press b
     again against that same name the individual is deleted. This seems a
     long-winded procedure so what's the short-cut please? :-)

A4.2 This is something that I've never really looked at but methinks either
     "Re-Org/Users" or "Re-Org/Address-book" should do what you want. I've
     just had a quick look at both of them and they also appear to be a bit
     long-winded :(

     ******

Q4.3 Next question - "where do all those addresses originate from ?" :-

A4.3 You'll have noticed with XPoint, that when an incoming mail bundle is
     being tossed, loadsa names and addresses flash up the screen - true ?
     All those names/addresses get bunged into a mixture of files named
     USER.xxx which then get used as XP's AddressBook database. One of the
     nice bits about that User database is that it acts as almost an
     extension to the Nodelist that you're using - quite handy if you want
     to whip orft a netmail to someone and for some reason you've mislaid
     their address, but you've remembered their name.

     It's main "snag" when doing that though, is when the addressee happens
     to be a Node who also uses a Point number for some activies. XP, in
     that case will just present you with the Nodelist entry information for
     the address. Similarly, if the name of a Point coincides with that of a
     Node's name :(

     *****


5. Templates
============

Q5.1 How does one arrange for an automatic salutation (i.e. "Hi xxxx,")
     to the xxxx adressee?

A5.1 This is done by tweeking two of the templates .....

     Goto "Edit/Templates" and select "PrivHead". This is the default
     template that is used by XP for private messages(netmail). In this
     one you could put something like "Hi $VORNAME", where the macro
     "$VORNAME" is translated as the addressee's christian name. The one
     to tweek for public messages(echomail) is "Head". As yet, I haven't
     found a macro that translates to the addressee's christian name only.

     *****

Q5.2 How does one arrange for a signature ending (e.g. "Regards,[LFCR]
     Geoff")?

A5.2 Yet another template to be tweeked .....

     Goto "Edit/Templates" and select "PrivSignature". This is the default
     template for private messages(netmail). In this one you could put
     something like "Regards,"
                    "Geoff"

     The one to tweek for public messages(echomail) is "Signature". You
     could put the same in here as in your private sig.

     *****


6. Miscellaneous
================

Q6.1 Where is the CONNECT speed recorded?

A6.1 XPFIDO.LOG is the main place. But the info's also given to you in the
     little "netmail" bunged into the /ØNetcall folder after you've made an
     outgoing call.

     *****

Q6.2 I've looked in the Netcall folder and the CONNECT: part is always
     blank. Is there a setting that I've missed somewhere?

A6.2 What I _think_ it is - if you go into your Edit==>Server, perhaps use
     your Bosses entry as the test one to try, select the Edit, then the
     Modem portion and add into the init string S95=3  Hopefully, that
     should fix it. XPoint doesn't seem to "like" large S95 values. You
     also need to have W2 enabled.

     *****

Q6.3 I'd have cut it out of my Netcall folder and placed it in here to
     show you (but I haven't worked out how to do that yet :-))  )

A6.3 While you're reading that message in the Netcall folder, you've got a
     couple of options open to you either:-

     a) Use W to write the full message contents to an ASCII file of your
     own naming convention, or

     b) Use ALT+I to dump just the amount displayed on the screen, to a
     similarly named file.

     Then, you can import the file into a message with the CTRL+K -
     then R command.

     *****

Q6.4 What's the significance of the R at the end of your tearline please?

A6.4 (R)egistered :-)

     *****

Q6.5 I've been wondering about that "Special" function?

A6.5 Now take this bit s-l-o-w and steady, if you don't then be it all on
     yer own head.

     When in that first screen. Select (S)pecial. You'll notice that the
     screen layout will alter slightly. Take note also that the Menu
     second-line choices also alter somewhat, might be an idea to make a
     note of them. Now select (S)pecial again to take you back to your
     original screen layout.

     Now, use your TAB key to go into your outgoing mail folders area.
     Select (S)pecial again. Again, there's a bit of a screen layout change
     plus alterations to that Menu second-line choice. (S)pecial again to
     get back to your original. Later on, when you've grown accustomed to it,
     you may find that you've no need to swap backwards and forwards with
     that (S)pecial choice. But you've _got_ to remember that there are
     changes in those "hotkey" choices - one or two can be semi-dangerous
     if you happen to forget.

     Now TAB back to your first screen. Select (S)pecial again. Now cursor
     over an Echo folder where it doesn't matter too much if you cock
     things up. Select the "Edit" choice of that second line. You'll find
     that you can pull a fair few tweaks :)  So, experiment.

     If you do the same sort of playing/experiment on an outgoing netmail
     folder in the other folder area, you'll find that you can pull some
     useful twiddles there as well.  have fun :)))))))

     If/when you do start having a look at, and/or use, that (S)pecial
     function - try to force yourself to remember that those 2nd line
     Hotkey choices have changed. Can be a shade dangerous if you forget :(

Q6.6 How do I add Tools to XP?

A6.6 The object of the following exercise is to add a "Tool" to XP, so that
     you can call it up as & when needed in a similar fashion to using XP's
     Archive Viewer Tool. As a starter example, I might have the following
     Tools available when I access that T from the top menu:-

=== Cut ===
     XPoint  Re-Org  Message  Netcall  Fido  Edit  Config  Tools
     All  Write  Textfile  Binary  Special  Show: from 23.+------------------+
                                                          › Calendar      @K ›
      /ØNetcall                                           › Archive Viewer   ›
      /ØNetzanruf                                         +------------------›
      /ØStatistics                                        › PC-Tools         ›
      /Archie                                             › Inspect-A        ›
     /Archie Swan                                Personal› NortonComm       ›
      /Sysop                                              +------------------+
=== Cut ===

     The way to add an additional Tool:-
     Select Config==>Tools_Menu and you'll be presented with a screen like:-

   +- Tools Menu ----------------------------------------------------------+
   ›     Menu           Program                    $FILE      S W L A  Mem ›
   › 1                                                                     ›
   › 2                                                                     ›
 and so on down to:
   › 9                                                                     ›
   › 10                                                                    ›
   +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

     Cursor over one of those numbered slots and press Enter - where you'll
     be presented with a screen that looks like the following:

   +- Tools+- Tools Menu <number of slot>--------------------------+-------+
  ›     Me›                                                       ›A  Mem ›

   › 5     ›  $FILE-Msg.     w/o header        [ ]   Subject-name ›       ›
  › 6     ›                                                       ›       ›
   › 7     ›   [ ]   Wait                                          ›       ›

           +-------------------------------------------------------+

     Fill in the bits as above, not forgetting to press Enter/Return on the
     last entry and Inspect will be available for use in that Tools menu.
     NOTE:-  That " ^ " character (shifted 6) is placed directly in front of
     the Letter that you wish to be used as the hotkey selection. So the
     above  ^Inspect-A gives me the I as the hotkey. Simple as that.

     *****

Q6.7 How do I upload a text file?

A6.7 Depends how you use the Textfile choice.

     1. Selecting it when you're just cursored over one of the Echomail
        Folders - yes, it works.  The text file gets converted into an
        Echomail message!

     2. If, however, you enter into one of the folders and cursor over one
        of the messages, say from me to you, and then select Textfile
        (to be found in the (O)ther menu selection) - you'll find that XP
        will present you with the Private Message (Netmail) choice screen.

     Needs to be used with a shade of care ;)

Q6.8 I was successful in sending a Crash Mail to the Node of a point earlier
     i.e. until I saw that the number being dialled was preceded by the
     international prefix 44- rather than the Nodelist number having the
     "44-" removed and replaced by "0". I immediately hung up but the
     question is where and how is this change done please?

A6.8 Menubar,  Fido===>Options, I have:-

     +- Fido Options ---------------------------------+

     +------------------------------------------------+

     This should fix things - if you change yours accordingly Note that:
     "Your dialing code" above refers to the international number followed
     by your telephone exchange area code.

Q6.9 What's this Macros busines? Care to illustrate?

A6.9 I decided that - come hellorhighwater - somehow I was going to use
     XP's terminal mode for the odd BBS call _without_ having to manually
     type in things such as ATDxxxxx then Name and then Password. My
     "get out" turned out to be that selection of Config==>Keys==>Macros

     Choice of New gives the following screen:-

     +--------------------------------------------------- [F2] -+

     Pressing F2 on that "Macro for" slot gives you control on where you
     want the Macro to be used. I didn't want it to be a Global selection,
     so I chose Terminal.

     "Comment" is just as it says - a small reminder about what you might
     have set the macro up for.

     "Key" - could be slightly tricky.  This is where you identify the
     particular "hotkey" that you're going to use.  Doesn't appear to accept
     Fxx keys, and although the length of the input "block" seems to indicate
     a fair amount can be bunged in there - only one of the normal Alpha,
     Numeric, or keys like Home/End etc., seem to be able to be accepted.
     So, you need to take a bit of care as to which key you select, then
     "tap" the key and an entry will appear in that slot.

     "Macro" - this accepts the keystrokes that you want to use, e.g. an
     entry of:-
     Geoff Bent^M
     is produced by typing:
     Geoff Bent as normal, and then the Return/Enter key.

     Note the small "help" info that appears at the top right of the screen
     for saving/exiting while you're inputting stuff in that Macro slot,
     as while you're in there - you can't get on-line help from the F1 key,
     even if you could read it.

     As a consequence, I started with 3 macros so that in Terminal mode -
     the Home key does the dialling out, then the End key tells the BBS my
     moniker, and the "`" (backwards apostrophe) gives the Password.

     Only starters this. But it looks like it could be useful.
