 <<C>>      toggles coloured <<bold>> Text on/off.
        (see [/Config/External/Lister])@237

With <<P>>, <<Ctrl-P>>, <<R>> and <<Ctrl-R>> you can

<<View Mode>>

Generally, you do not want to see <<all>> messages
in the database. There may be too many, some you
may have already read, others may be old, etc.
For this reason, CrossPoint allows you to select
which messages to read.

The following selection criteria are available:


<<All>>    All messages are displayed.

<<Unread>> All messages that you have not read,
       regardless of age.

<<New>>    Shows messages since the last netcall or
       since importing a Puffer-File. Empty netcalls
       or Puffers are not counted.

<<Today>>  Selects messages that came in on the current
       date.

<<Date>>   Selects messages that came in after a date,
       which you may specify.

<<Time>>   You can fine tune the date above to specify a
       a time of day, to filter more precisely.

<<Save>>   Saves a set time as a dummy time of last
       netcall. Thus, you can save the time at which
       a netcall was made with this setting, make
       subsequent netcalls but still use "New" to
       call up all messages since the saved time.

When setting dates or times, the "+" & "-" keys can
be used to step through single days or minutes.

It is *deliberate* that the packer is repeatedly
recalled to unpack several files.

@
68
This is the <<Send-Window>> in CrossPoint. Here is
decided if and how a message will actually be sent

<<Yes>>     The Message is sent as it is.

<<No>>      The Message is not sent and discarded. It
        can however still be found in the file
        called LASTMSG in the temp. directory.
        as long as no other mail is written.

<<Internal>> The message is not sent out , but sent to
         the Newsgroup it was written to (also
         PM Newsgroups) for storage.

<<Special>> Shows some extra functions. You can
        always select all functions by their
        hot-key letters.

<<Subject>> changes the subject text.

<<Box>>     allows the server box to be selected,
        that the message should go to.

<<Code>>    Changes the encoding of the message. PMs
        can only be changed, when the recipient
        has a password entered

<<Text>>    Return to the Editor to edit further.
        (Not with binary messages).

<<Copies>>  Up to 50 recipients (Users and News-
        groups) can be set to receive copies.
        Note however, it is frowned upon to send
        the same message to several Newsgroups
        in the same net!

<<Special-Functions:

<<Park>>    The message is parked in the Newsgroup
        /¯unsent (will be created if it does not
        exist). From there you can re-edit it or
        send it on with Message/Forward/Repost
        (Alt-R)

<<Date>>    Puts the message in the Autosend List
        (Edit/AutoSend); it can be sent at a
        programmed time.

<<RRQ>> Requests an (automatic) confirmation of
        receipt from the recipient to be sent back.
        Note advice about "Request Confirmation"
        in XPOINT.DOC.

<<withoutSig>> Leaves off the automatic signature.

<<Delete>>  Sets the message straight to delete, so
        it will be deleted in the next Re-Org after
        it is sent.

<<Crash>>   (Fido). The message is readied for a
        direct call [/Fido/Crash].@13104

<<Prio>>    (ZConnect) sets how the message in will
        sent, [Direct Mail] or [Express Mail].@4004
        Beware! Both will likely cost money!

<<More>>    (ZConnect/UseNet) shows dialog boxes for
        [stand-in] address and [Keywords].@851 852
        Select it and see!

<<MausNet>> (Maus) appends "(MausNet)" to the message
        and it will not be sent over gates.

<<local>>   (Maus) appends "(lokal)" to the message
        and it will be sent no further than your
        local Server.

<<<Esc> >>  The message is discarded. If the option
      <</Config/Options/Messages/../¯Unsent>> is
        enabled, the message is <<parked>> (see above).
        Even if not, the message can be retrieved,
        it exists in the <<TEMP directory>> under the
        name <<LASTMSG>> (only as long as no other
        message has been written!).

<</>>       Changes the recipient of the message.
        Delete the current entry to choose (with <F2>)
        between users and newsgroups.
        ATTENTION! only experienced users should
        use this function.


If the <<server>> is shown in <<brackets>>, it means that
several copies of the message will be sent over
<<different servers>>.

@
69
<<Yes>>  -> CrossPoint attaches the attribute VERBOSE
        to the request.
@
70
Give the name of the target Newsgroup, or you can
select if you press <F2>. All messages in the source
Newsgroup will be moved into the target, EXCEPT
outgoing messages
@
71
<<[x]>> ->  Toggle the "x" on and off with <space>.
        On=the messages are given the new Newsgroup
        name.

<<[ ]>> ->  Off=the messages are not renamed. If they
        are ever imported again, they will land in
        the *old* Newsgroup.
@
72
Give the name of the target User, or press <F2> and
select from the list. All messages in the source
user's Area will be moved to the target user's area.
EXCEPT outgoing messages.

Case (upper/lower) is not significant.
@
73
Enter some part of the name which is to be searched
for in the User List. All names that fit will be
marked.

Note: Previous markings will remain. This means you
can mark more if you wish, but may confuse your
operation if you are not expecting it. Ctrl-E will
unmark *everything* marked (so do it *before* your
next search if necessary).
@
74
Enter the File Name where the marked lines should
be saved. If nothing is marked, the whole text will
be saved. <Esc> breaks off.

If no other path is given, XP puts the file in the
Extract Directory [/Config/Path/Extract].@261

With F2 you can copy to the Windows-Clipboard.

<<Windows-Clipboard>>
copies the marked Text to the Clipboard

<<Win-Clipboard (URL)>>
tries to generate a Internet-URL
(FTP:// or HTTP:// or WWW.) from the first marked
line and copies it to the Windows-Clipboard.

<<Win-Clipboard (MAIL)>>
like before, but generates a Mail-Adress.

@
75
Enter the File Name where the decoded file should be
saved. <Esc> breaks off.


If no other path is given, XP puts the file in the
Extract Directory [/Config/Path/Extract].@261
@
76
<<A>>  -> Append to an existing file with this name.

<<O>>  -> Overwrite an existing file with this name.

<<C>>  -> Cancel the operation, data not saved.
@
77
<<Yes>>  -> Delete entry

<<Nein>> -> DO NOT delete entry

<<Datei>>-> Delete Entry and its file.
@
78
<<Primary Server>> For CrossPoint a "base" server.
        XP always suggests this choice first for
        new Newsgroups or when making Netcalls.
        Note: A Primary Server *must* be entered.
        Changing Servers see also
        [/Re-Org/Misc../change server]@13305

<<Primary Fido Server>> Serves as *your* address
        which has to be made known when sending
        Crash Mails or Requests. Therefore in FIDO
        a primary Fido server must be entered.
@
79
Select which FIDO Box should be dialled. All boxes
are listed for which Crash Mails or File Requests or
File Transfer Requests have been entered.
The letters to the left of the name show which kind
of the above call each is due to make.

  <<C>>   Crash Mails or File Attaches
  <<R>>   File Requests

The recipients for crash mails and/or details of
stored file requests/transfers are shown in the
lower portion of the window, for the selected Box.

Select <<other>> to dial some other box of your choice.

Select <<all>> to start an action to call all of the
boxes with something to send.

Pressing "E" allows you to edit the entry for the
selected box, or delete the entry.

If you have mail or file requests for one of your own
servers (one you have under /Edit/Servers), you
should do that with a normal net call rather than
trying to make a crash call/request [Netcall/Single].@11501

@
80
Dial the selected Node or Point and press <Enter>,
or break off with <Esc>.
@
81
You have selected a message with a File Attach:-
a text message to which a file is linked to be sent.

<<Yes>>  -> CrossPoint lists the contents of *file*.
        The "Subject" of the message is the file
        name. If no other path is defined, it is in
        the directory defined under /Config/Paths for
        [FileReq-Directory.]@264

<<No>> ->   CrossPoint shows the contents of the
        *message*
@
82
Select the data base you want and press <Enter>,
or break off with <Esc>.
@
83
Put the cursor on the file you want and mark it by
pressing <Space>. Confirm it with <Enter>.
Break off with <Esc>.
@
84
Select the macro to be run and press <Enter>.
Break off with <Esc> or <F6>.

Recording and editing macros is done under
/Config/Keys/Macros.
@
85
Put the cursor on the required file list and press
<Enter>. Break off with <Esc>.

The following information is displayed for all file
lists present (from left to right):

þ the node address of the Box
þ Name and Location of the Box
þ The date of the list file in the form Month/Year
þ The name of the list file, without extension ".FL"
þ The size of the file list in KByte

All File Lists are to found in the subdirectory
"FIDO" under the XP directory.

If "???" appears as the name of the box, it means
this Box is no longer to be found in the node list.
Probably it has changed its node number.
If you can find out the new node number, copy the
 file list to any new file name, delete the old
list (Fido/File Lists/delete), and read the file in
again from the file you just copied with
FIDO/File Lists/Import.

@
86
Enter a new Subject for the message, or accept the
old Subject with <Enter>
@
87
Enter the new password for FileScan. Only *after*
getting confirmation from FileScan, you should change
the password under /Edit/Servers/Edit/Fido.
@
88
Enter the desired new Subject, or break off with
<Esc>
@
89
Select the required file, or break off with <Esc>

You can see the size and date of each selected file
or the selected type of drive in the lower part of
the window.

In addition to selecting the Drive letter ([C:]), the
<Ctrl> key can be used, e.g. <<Ctrl-C>> for Drive C:
@
90
Enter the name of the "recipient" for the public
message. This usually if you are answering something
he/she wrote, enabling him/her to see the reply
easily. In this case the name will be offered by XP
but occasionally you may wish to enter another name.

For new, general messages it is usual to enter "All",
here (just to fill the space ;-). The default for
new messages can be set under [/Fido/Options.]@728
@
91
(MausNet only) Select which status a message should
be given:

<<read>>    The sender is informed that the message has
        been read

<<pending>> The sender is informed, that the message
        has been put pending to be attended to at a
        later time

<<Esc>>     No status is sent. The message remains as
        "not read"

If you do not want this status question, you can
switch it off under /Config/Options/Nets. XP
reports all incoming messages as "read".

@
94
A complete message may be made up of many lines.
Cursor over the desired line and press <Enter> to
either read the message or display the contents of
the file. Pressing <<X>> will save the file to disk.

To view the complete original message, cursor over
"Whole Message" and press <Enter>.

@
101
All messages coming into the data base are marked
with the receive-date. This is normally the same
date as that of the incoming buffer file. In this
way, XP can display messages (in the message window)
in the correct order.

If, however, you should import a buffer file by hand,
the import date could be quite different from any
original receive-date, which could lead to messages
being shown in the wrong order, or staying too long
in the data base.

By setting "receive date = creation date", XP reads
the creation date (when written) out of the header,
and uses it as receive-date. This can bring its own
problems, that messages are deleted too quickly.
@
102
When a buffer file is imported automatically after a
netcall, XP knows where it has come from, and can
allocate the correct server to any new Newsgroups.

This may not be clear for buffers imported by hand,.
and could lead to unwanted results.
With "take server from message path", XP can read
the last entry (or, for Z-Connect, the first) from
the message path, and assume that this is the server.
(Can of course also be wrong, depending on where you
got the buffer file from).

If this option is switched off, or if the message
path is empty, XP will use the Primary Server as
set under /Edit/Servers/Select.
@
103
<<[x]>> ->  For messages whose subject begins with
        "\##", XP sends an Acknowledge Receipt
        automatically, as long as the Option under
        /Options/Messages is set.

Use this option for failed netcalls, when the buffer
has to be imported by hand.
@
110
Enter the expressions to search for. Empty fields
are ignored.

See also: [Search Options]@531
          [Search Newsgroups]@532
@
120
Enter the name of the file to which the selected
message(s) should be extracted to. If nothing is
entered, XP shows a list of files to select from.

If the selected file already exists, the choice is
offered, whether to overwrite it or append to it.
@
130
For configuring the Servers from which you receive
your incoming mail and through which you send your
outgoing mail.

You may configure as many as you wish and they are
displayed in alphabetical order of Server name, with
numbers a la FIDO at the top.

<<New>>     Enter details for a new Server.

<<Delete>>  Delete the selected Server from the list.
        You will be prompted for confirmation.
        All details will then be lost.

<<Select>>  Select the Server (under the cursor) as
        [Primary Server.]@78

<<Edit>>    Calls up the menu for editing details
        concerning all aspects of Netcalls (Polls).
        This data is stored in a file with the
        name of the Server and the extension .BFG

<<Net type>> Changes the net type of the selected
        Server. A list is presented to select from.

  Note: The net type cannot be changed while there
        are messages waiting to be sent.

 Note2: The English Language Module blanks out the
        purely German net types. So, for example,
        Maus will not to be available.


<<OK>>      Exits the Server configuration.
        You may also exit by pressing <Esc>.

@
131
<<Point>>   The settings concerning your Point in
        the server. These settings must correspond
        with those in the server.

<<Modem>>   Parameters governing the behaviour
        of the modem during netcalls.

<<Charges>> The information entered here allows XP
        to calculate (approximately) the telephone
        charges from netcalls.

<<Names>>   For entering User, Box etc. names.

<<"Net">>   The net type is shown here. Settings
        specific to that net.

<<Misc.>>   Various settings, e.g. for On-line
        operations.

<<SysopMode>> Tells CrossPoint to put the poll
        packet onto the local hard disk, rather
        than send it over a modem. (It can then be
        read into some other application by hand)

@
139
Dial the selected Server or abort off with <Esc>.
@
140
<<Pointname>>, ("Nodename") that you have agreed with
your Sysop. It's kind of like the name of your
pigeonhole in the Server, where it puts mails
addressed to you for you to collect. Don't confuse it
with your Username, which is effectively your address
at this box to which people write. This mail to your
name is put by the box into your Point and you call
up your Point (by *its* name) to collect your mail.

To confuse the issue, some nets use the Username as
the point name.
(eg. GS-Mailboxes, QuickMail and  MagicNET)
@
141
<<MausNet:>>
Enter your *Login* Password here.

<<all other nets:>>
Enter your *Point* Password here, as agreed with
your Sysop. Do not confuse your [Point] password@140
with your normal User Password for BBS calls.
You can use the same password for both (but it's not
good security).
@
142
The telephone number of your Server (Boss). Should
it have several numbers you can call, you can enter
the numbers separated by a <<space>>. CrossPoint will
then try each number in turn, until it gets through.
@
143
<<Z-Netz, Seven>>

<<0000>>
This is theoretically the serial number of the
Mailbox software (in these nets) in the server.
When *Servers* call each other, they compare
their *real* numbers, if they use this type of
software. If the calling box has the same number
as the called box, they break off. A kind of copy
protection. Therefore a called up box expects to
hear a number. Other kinds of software, have to have
a possibility to offer a number that will not cause
problems with this copy protection, and this number
is 0000. Enter <<0000>> here.

<<MagicNET>>

Enter <<2200>> here.

@
144
The upload [transfer protocol] for transferring@4005
your mail packets *to* the server. <F2> allows to
select from a list for the most common ones, and
gives you the parameters (GSZ,DSZ,BiModem).

Enter the program call and the parameters here for
an *upload to* the server.

You must agree a protocol with your Sysop!

Important! For GSZ/DSZ you *must* give the file name
extension (e.g. GSZ.EXE) COM or EXE otherwise XP
cannot recognise when a transfer is broken off
through an error. For the same reason, the $LOGFILE
call in BiModem is important (BiModem does not give
an errorlevel, but writes in a log what happened)

<<BIMODEM /L $PORT /U $UPFILE /I $LOGFILE

It is also important to use BiModem version 1.24
or higher.

Make sure the transfer program is somewhere
(current directory, DOS PATH or give XP the
full path), where XP can find it.

This field can use the following macros (variables):
which XP provides internally (using data you have
entered elsewhere).

<<$PORT>>   The number of the [COM Port] in use,@10605
        1,2,3 or 4

<<$ADDRESS>> The HEX [address] of the COM Port@290
        (see also Config/Modem/COM x)

<<$IRQ>>    the [IRQ-Number] of the port@291

<<$SPEED>>  the current port speed setting in bps,
        i.e. 2400,9600,19200 etc.

<<$UPFILE>> The name of the file to be *sent*.
        (MUST be present, either in this form or
        its real name

<<$LOGFILE>> The log file in BiModem-Format. It is a
        MUST when using BiModem, useful when using
        others.

These macros are replaced when the time comes with
the correct values. A typical call to DSZ would be:

<<DSZ.EXE port $PORT sz $UPFILE

@
145

The download [transfer protocol] for transferring@4005
your mail packets *from* the server. <F2> allows to
select from a list for the most common ones, and
gives you the parameters (GSZ,DSZ,BiModem).

Enter the program call and the parameters here for
a *download from* the server.

You must agree a protocol with your Sysop!

Important! For GSZ/DSZ you *must* give the file name
extension (e.g. GSZ.EXE) COM or EXE otherwise XP
cannot recognise when a transfer is broken off
through an error.

<<IMPORTANT BiModem:
*leave the download line empty*
BiModem transfers in both directions at once, and is
started with the Upload line.
It is also important to use <<BiModem version 1.24
(or higher).

Make sure the transfer program is somewhere
(current directory, DOS PATH or give XP the
full path), where XP can find it. But XP even
beeps and warns you if, when you leave the
dialog box, it cannot "see" the program you
entered somewhere.

This field can use the following macros (variables):
which XP provides internally (using data you have
entered elsewhere).

<<$PORT>>   The number of the [COM Port] in use,@10605
        1,2,3 or 4

<<$ADDRESS>> The HEX [address] of the COM Port@290
        (see also Config/Modem/COM x)

<<$IRQ>>    the [IRQ-Number] of the port@291

<<$SPEED>>  the current port speed setting in bps,
        i.e. 2400,9600,19200 etc.

<<$DOWNFILE>> The name of the file to be *received*.
        (MUST be present, either in this form or
        its real name.)

<<$LOGFILE>>  The log file in BiModem-Format. Useful
        for other programs, do not enter BiModem
        in the Download line.

These macros are replaced when the time comes with
the correct values. A typical call to DSZ would be:

<<DSZ.EXE port $PORT rz $DOWNFILE

@
146
<<Upload Packer (Compressor)>>

The [Upload Packer] is used to compress the mail@4006
packets which are to be uploaded <<TO>> the
Server (Boss). The packer is an external programme
which compresses data prior to transfer and is more
commonly known as an archiver. It is advisable to use
a packer but not absolutely necessary.

For a start, you could get PKZIP, LHA, ARJ or RAR.
<<(Confirm this with your Sysop.)>>

If you use one of these (or other well known ones),
XP gives you a simple pick-list (<F2>) and all
the parameters are pre-entered.

Just make sure that the packer .EXE file is where
CrossPoint can find it. If in doubt, just put it in
the CrossPoint directory but the DOS path will do
also.

The following macros are available, which are
replaced by CrossPoint at the right time
with the correct values.


<<$UPFILE>> the name of the compressed file.
        (is fixed because the transfer protocol
        also has to use it).


<<$PUFFER>> the file that is to be compressed.
        (the outgoing mail packet created by
         CrossPoint).

Make sure XP can find the Packer (in the current
directory, DOS PATH (see DOS handbook) or enter the
full path name). All parameters are entered for
you. XP even <<beeps>> to warn you if, when you exit the
dialog box, it cannot find the packer.

If you do not know which [packer] to use, ask your@4006
Sysop!

<<Unpacked Transfer (Z-Netz)
It may be worthwhile sending unpacked data, if your
modem can pack it (MNP5 or V42bis). This saves above
all on-line time, because the server only packs when
you call, and you have to wait while it packs.

MNP5 or V42bis are not so good as packers, so it
needs to be checked with care. Does the time saved
through not waiting for the packer make up for the
time lost through less effective packing?

You can pack for upload and not for download, but the
difference for usual small upload is insignificant.

Some boxes allow this unpacked service (not all, ask
your Sysop)

In this case, just use "copy" instead of a packer!

copy $PUFFER $UPFILE

<<unpacked transfer (MausNet)
See above Z-Netz, but as above with "COPY"

<<unpacked transfer (Fido/UUCP)
Delete the Upload packer entry completely to
transfer your mail packet uncompressed to your Boss.

<<MagicNET
If your server is an AlphaBox, you must enter
an ARC type packer (PKARC or similar). The stupid
thing doesn't support anything else!

<<Batch File substitute

The program you enter will simply be started, so it
can also be a batch file. With this, you can do other
things like make backup copies etc. before packing
but at the end, a proper $UPFILE file (ie. proper
name and proper format) must be left for XP to
continue.

@

<<Download UnPacker (De-Compressor)>>

The [Download UnPacker] is needed to unpack the mail@4006
bundles which you download <<FROM>> the
Server (Boss).

The downloaded mail bundle must be unpacked but what
comes out of it is governed by what went in and does
not need to be specified. In FIDO especially, it is
not fixed and CrossPoint will deal this for you.

The unpacker is an external programme which
decompresses data after transfer.
You must have one of these.

For a start, get PKUNZIP, LHA, ARJ or RAR.
<<(Confirm this with your Sysop)>>

If you use one of these (or other well known ones),
XP gives you a simple choice list (<F2>) and all
the parameters are pre-entered.

Just make sure that the unpacker .EXE file (it is
often the same one as the packer but just with a
different command parameter but PKUNZIP for example,
is specially for unpacking) is where CrossPoint can
find it. If in doubt, just put it in the CrossPoint
directory, but the DOS path will do also.

The following macros are available and are
replaced by CrossPoint at the right time
with the correct entries.


<<$DOWNFILE>>  the name of the incoming mail bundle.
          (is fixed because the transfer protocol
           also has to use it).


<<$PUFFER>> the name of the file after it is
        unpacked. It is actually fixed, since it
        depends on what the file which was packed
        was called. <<Useful for unpacked transfers.>>

Make sure XP can find the UnPacker (in the current
directory, DOS PATH (see DOS handbook) or enter the
full path name). All parameters are entered for
you. XP even <<beeps>> to warn you if, when you exit the
dialog box, it cannot find the unpacker.

If you do not know which [unpacker] to use, ask your@4006
Sysop!

<<Unpacked Transfer (Z-Netz)

transfer your packet unpacked to the server.

This is the file name extension for the packed
file as recognised by the respective packers.
For the usual packers they are as follows:

   PKARC  -  ARC
   LHarc  -  LZH
   LHA    -  LZH
   PKZip  -  ZIP
   ARJ    -  ARJ

For unpacked transfer by X-modem or Z-Modem, the
extension is not important, and should be left empty.
There is no standard for unpacked BiModem transfers,
Trial and Error with your Sysop is called for!
@

This is the type of transfer protocol that will be
used for MausTausch. The standard ones are:

Your Point number, as given to you by your Boss.
@
152
If the Server does not support 4D Addressing, you
have to enter here a "Point Net" (so called "Fake
Net") number. You get this from your Boss. If in
doubt, ask! Otherwise, don't use this field.
@
153
Your [Point Password] ("Session-Password"), which you@4008
agreed with your Boss.
@
154
Here you can enter a list of "AKA" [("Also Known As")]@4009
which CrossPoint sends <<in addition>> to the main
Server address during a netcall (assuming the Server
supports the [EMSI] (a FIDO specific) transfer@158
protocol.) The individual addresses must be separated
by a <space>. Make sure you enter them correctly!
If you use 4D Addressing, your own Point Number
must be included in the AKA list!
@
155
You can enter a list of FIDO Servers here, messages
for which will be all be sent in the same Netcall.
This is needed to send messages into the various
[FIDO compatible nets.]@4009
See also FIDO.DOC.
@
156
4D Addresses are a new standard, which are by now
supported by nearly all FIDO Box programs.

If in doubt, ask your Sysop.

If the switch "Use Node Address" is ON, (also found
here), then this setting is inactive.
@
157
Some "Tossers" in FIDO Box software, especially
"TosScan", have problems dealing with mails from
point programs unknown to them. Since CrossPoint is
relatively new, it is not "known".

If problems should arise, this switch will deal with
them. There are two possibilities:

- Either you switch it on all the time, sort of
  "just in case",

- or you switch it on only when you recognise that
  there are these types of problems with your
  netcalls.

Technical note: When this switch is on, XP uses the
FTSC product code from d'bridge, so that TosScan can
recognise it as 4D. In any case XP also uses the code
for its own internal XP-FM Mailer (E9h).

@
158
The FIDO Mailer in CrossPoint supports both connect
protocols YooHoo and EMSI. XP will always try to use
EMSI, the better of the two, if the other side
supports it.

Normally you should leave the EMSI switch ON.
But if you should get problems with EMSI netcalls,
you can force CrossPoint to use YooHoo by switching
EMSI off. If problems occur, you can often find the
cause noted in the log file XP runs on FIDO
activities, XPFIDO.LOG. (Read it with an ordinary
editor)
@
159
Many Fido Boxes have a radio clock like DCF77 in
Germany, keeping them always synchronised to accurate
time. An EMSI netcall often sends the time, and by
setting this switch you can have your PC use this
time to set its internal clock, synchronising you
also to accurate time (within about +/- 2 sec.).

If you use the [programmed timing lists] for Cross-@11507
Point activities, you could even have it call a box
with a radio clock specially, at regular intervals,
just to get the time, even if you don't poll Fido
otherwise!
@
8040
<<[x]>> ->  A netcall will get mails and Newsgroups.

<<Only for advanced Users:>>

Here, you can define the ZModem protocol options for
the Fido-Mailer. Normally, this field will be empty
and the Fido-Mailer will operate with the correct
parameters.

Possible options:

<<-r>>   Crash Recovery.

<<-ti>>  Timeout Duration .....

     The number of "inactive" seconds the protocol
     will wait before timing out. By default, it
     will wait 300 seconds (-t300) before timing
     out. This may need to be increased for File
     Requests, as some Mailers need to search
     through large filebases and therefore, need
     more time.

<<-88>>  Start sending in 8K blocks immediately.
     This is desirable with an error-free
     connection.

A complete list of options will be found in
ZM-GER.DOC in the PD-ZModem archive.

@
8000
A (very) few Fido boxes require the point password,
to be sent additionally inside the poll packet you
send (as a so-called "session password"). Activating
this switch will cause that to happen.

Your Sysop will tell you if it is necessary or not.
@
8001
In some of the [Fido compatible nets] points use a@4009
[node address] instead of a point address. If this@4010
is the case, you must set this switch, and put the
*node number* in the space for the point number.
If your server has the number 12:345/67, and you have
been allocated the node number 89, then your address
is 12:345/89. Your *node* number is 89.
@
8002
Some Fido servers give problems, in that they only
send you something, when they actually receive some-
thing from you. If you haven't any mails to send, you
would get nothing. Why this problem exists is one of
life's great mysteries, but this switch gets round
it, whatever the cause. It causes a packet to be
sent with effectively nothing in it.

In *rare* cases that can cause problems of its own,
when the box software doesn't know what to do with
an empty packet, but that, dear reader, is another
story...
@
8003
Incoming Fido message packets normally have a file
extension made out of the day of the week plus a
number, eg. *.MO3 or *.TU1.

But not all. For example some boxes now put a letter
on instead of a number (*.MOA).

If you should be served by a box that sends files
with different names from "standard", you must
activate this switch, so that packets with non
standard names are imported. Your Sysop can tell
you what to expect from his box.

This means of course, that XP cannot recognise
files which really are other types so easily, so for
example a file with extension MOD, that is not a mail
packet, lands in the SPOOL subdirectory and not in
your file request directory as it otherwise would.
(All mail packets go temporarily to SPOOL to be
worked on)

@
8005
Enter your two digit Point number here.
@
8006
This is the name used during the Log On to start the
netcall module in the box. Here should nearly always
<<NET410>> be entered.

Some QuickMail boxes (a German net) offer extra
features which can be called up using other names
here. Ask your Sysop about this.
@
8010
This is the packet size that CrossPoint suggests to
the called system. The bigger the packet size, the
faster the data transfer rate.

Many incomplete UUCP implementations have diffi-
culties with larger packets, sometimes even above
128 bytes, and break off the connection. In such
cases you have to set CrossPoint to small packet
sizes here.

CrossPoint can always adapt itself to the other
side and supports all possible packet sizes from
64 up to 4096 bytes.
@
8011
This is the so-called "UUCP Window" size. This
decides how many packets will be sent before the
sending system waits for an acknowledgement.

Possible window sizes are 3 to 7. Normally the
setting 7 works fine, and speeds things up.
@
8012
A UUCP-g connection usually tries to send packets
always of the same size. This is however inefficient
especially with small quantities of data.

Better UUCP systems are able to work with variable
packet sizes, which helps efficiency, but above all
is the only way that works with HST Modems.
If in doubt you just have to try whether the transfer
works with variable packet sizes.

CrossPoint adapts itself to whatever packet size the
other side sends, and can work with any size mixture.
@
8013
<<[ ]>> ->  CrossPoint uses the packet size as
        requested by the called system.

<<[x]>> ->  The packet size as set above will be
        used for sending and receiving, regardless.

In cases where the received packet is significantly
bigger than that sent (eg. 1024 against 64 bytes),
the transfer rate can sometimes be increased by
raising and fixing the size of the send packet
with this switch. It depends also on the system at
the other end, whether this works.
@
8014
<<[x]>> ->  CrossPoint offers the called system a
        "size negotiation". This means that each
        informs the other of the file size each time
        before it is transferred. This gives for
        example a more meaningful display on the
        screen during the transfer.
"Size Negotiation" is not supported by all UUCP
systems, but it does not normally lead to problems,
since the called system can simply ignore it.
@
8015
For setting which of the UUCP transfer protocols
offered by the called system will be accepted by
CrossPoint.

If all or more than one is marked to use, CrossPoint
has preferences. If all are marked, CrossPoint will
use UUCP-g over UUCP-e if offered. If you wish to
force UUCP-e, you must switch off UUCP-g.

<<UUCP-g>>  This is a standard protocol that all
        UUCP systems support. It offers a fairly
        error free transfer, but is very slow
        for small size [data packets]@8010


<<UUCP-G>>  This is a slightly improved version of
        UUCP-g, which enables on some systems the
        use of [variable size] data packets.@8012

<<UUCP-z>>  This is a non standard protocol, but is
        offered by many German UUCP systems. It
        offers a high transfer rate together with
        adequate error control and is very suitable
        for modem links which already have an error
        correction through MNP5 or V.42.

<<UUCP-f>>  This is only suitable for transfer of
        *unpacked* data across links with MNP5 or
        V.42 error correction. Use it only when
        UUCP-g is too slow, and UUCP-z is not
        available.

<<UUCP-e>>  This gives very good transfer rates, but
        offers no error control. It is only suitable
        for modems offering error correction like
        MNP5 or V.42 when in addition data loss at
        the serial port (also of the called system!)
        is certain not to happen.

        Do not use under multitasking environments
        like Windows!

@
8016
CrossPoint announces itself to the called system with
this name. If nothing else has been agreed, this is
the same as your System Name or Point Name.
@
8017
<<[x]>> ->  When "on" your Mails (PMs) will be sent
        via "Batched SMTP" (AKA BSMTP). This means
        instead of sending each message as a separate
        file, they are bundled together as a package,
        which raises the transfer rate considerably.

Not all UUCP systems support this, so if in doubt
ask your systems operator.
@
8020
With this program, all messages going to the server
are [packed], or compressed. You select the settings@4006
for <<compress>>, <<freeze>>, or <<gzip>> by press-
ing F2. If you prefer to transfer [unpacked], you can@4006
leave this field empty.

Compress is supported by nearly all UUCP-servers,
Freeze by most; gzip (Gnu ZIP) is pretty new but
getting popular fast. If in doubt ask your systems
operator. If several packers are on offer, you can
mostly change without special agreement with the
server.

Compress offers extra possibilities, a choice between
12 bit (parameter -b12, less compression) and 16 bit,
(parameter -b16, higher compression), but again,
consult your system operator if in doubt.

Here some quick guidance:
(+ = good, o = medium, - = bad)

                ³     Speed       ³ Compression
ÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÅÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ

With this program CrossPoint UNpacks messages which
have been packed with 'Compress'. These settings do

Some UUCP systems exchange data at Log-In with
"even parity". Suffice it to say here, if your
system operator tells you to use "7/e/1" or "E/7/1"
or something like "7 bit with even parity", you
should activate this switch.
@
160
CrossPoint waits this many seconds after sending the
command to dial to receive a "connect" answer. After
this time CrossPoint breaks off, and starts waiting
for the next try.

Note: many Modems also have such a setting, often
set to 60 seconds as default. That is probably what
is happening if the call is aborted sooner than you
expect. Check your modem handbook about increasing
this value if you need to (often "S Registers")
@
161
CrossPoint waits this many seconds after the
"connect" message, to obtain a successful Log-In.

If this time expires, XP hangs up and waits for the
next try.

Note: These cost money, since the other side
answered the phone! You can set the number of
these attempts separately in another box here,
[Max. Connects],to limit costs@166
@
162
CrossPoint waits this many seconds after an aborted
netcall attempt, before trying again.
@
163
This sets the number of times CrossPoint will try to
call a number if it does not achieve a successful
netcall, at intervals set by Dial Pause.

Since some boxes are often engaged (busy), it may be
necessary to set 20 or 30 attempts here, set at
perhaps 90 seconds intervals (too frequently is
not recommended).

You can protect against disaster if the other side
should answer every time and you get billed for 30
useless call, by setting "max. connects" separately.

If the number of tries has been made without
success, CrossPoint stops trying and carries on
with the next programmed activity, if any, or
returns to the CrossPoint screen.
@
164
This limits the number of attempts <<during one
<<connect>> that CrossPoint will make to log on.
Not to be confused with the setting for
"max. connects".

After this number of tries, CrossPoint gives up, and
waits for the next dialling attempt.

If the Log-In does not work with 2 or 3 attempts
(repeat, when the phone gets answered, not engaged
tones or no answer) there is something wrong.

If you do not know exactly that your side is working
correctly, check that your Point Name and password
are entered correctly.
You may find a clue by starting CrossPoint with the
/d switch (debug), which shows you more of what is
happening at Log-In, and try looking in the file
ERRORS.LOG, where errors are recorded.

Otherwise, maybe the server has a problem, wait a
while, maybe it gets fixed, or call your system
operator (Sysop) for help.

@
165
After a successfully log on, the server starts to
gather the data together to send to you, and to
[pack it]. Especially if there is a lot, this can@4006
take some minutes. You can set a time limit in
seconds here, to prevent CrossPoint waiting all
night on the phone if something does go wrong, but
be fairly generous here; 10 minutes (600 seconds)
should be enough for a "normal" user, but if you have
a slow server (286er or something) or a lot of data,
it can be more.

You should observe your netcalls sometimes, to see
how long is usual.

<<NOTE>> Some modems have a setting to abort after a
certain time if no data is transferred (inactivity
timeout), again to protect the user from high phone
bills. This must obviously be set slightly higher
than CrossPoint's limit. If the call gets aborted
before the CrossPoint timer reaches 00:00, this may
be the cause. Check your modem handbook.

@
166
Limits the number of tries where a connect happens
but goes wrong.

There are 2 types of failed netcall attempt:

o  There was no connection; the box was busy
   or didn't answer. This is annoying, but
   doesn't cost anything.

o  There was a connection, the box answered the
   phone, but something went wrong after that.
   These cost money, so you don't want CrossPoint
   making one of these for every one of a possibly
   large number of attempts you have allowed for
   when the box is busy.

Here you can limit separately the number of attempts
when a connect happens. Obviously CrossPoint must
then break off attempts to reach this box this
session, so as not to risk another failed connect.

For example, if you set "max Connects" to 3, and
"max. dialling attempts" to 50, CrossPoint will try
up to 50 times as long as the phone is not answered,
but will give up directly after the third time that
a connect happened without a successful netcall.

@

The figure you enter here determines the minimum
cps rate for Zmodem transfers. If the transfer drops
below this figure for two minutes, the transfer will

A setting of <<0>> disables this feature!

You can enter a default setting for resetting
your modem (see modem handbook about resetting,
or initialising) under the menu /Config/Modem.

If you need different settings for different
servers, you can enter them here.

The default reset will sent first, then the box
specific settings <<additionally>>.

Note: like the dialling command, you have to prefix
this command line with "AT" (or whatever your modem
needs, but they are nearly all AT

If you wish to send a <Enter> to the modem, you can
put a "\\" in the line. After this a new AT will be
necessary before carrying on. eg. ATE1\\ATS13=32.
This is usually not necessary, all the commands can
strung together after one AT, but occasionally a
modem will prefer a <Enter> after certain commands
before it accepts it properly.

@
169
The COM Port number to which the modem to be used
for dialling the selected box is connected.
Ports COM1 to COM4 are supported.

This selects the COM Port to be used, whereas under
/Config/Modem/COMx the ports in general are set up.

Also make sure that the port settings, to be found
under menu /Config/Modem/Com(x), are correct.
Especially using COM3 and COM4 can be tricky, and
proper IRQ numbers and port addresses are essential
(see On-Line Help there).
@
170
This is for setting the port speed, "baud rate"
"DTE speed" or "DTE rate", the bit rate for data
transfer between modem and computer. This speed can,
but must not be the same as the bit rate, as
achieved by the connect, the "link rate", across
the telephone line.

This setting can be tricky, because it is must also
be set at the modem end of this cable. Most modems
do this automatically, but if they are set to adjust
it later automatically to the "link rate", it may
become different, leading to problems.
It is best to set the modem to "hold DTE rate"
and not adjust (see modem handbook).

Modems which can compress data (MNP5, V.42) send
less data out over the telephone than they get from
the computer, so the link computer<->modem (DTE rate)
must be faster than the modem "connect" (link rate).

As a rule,
pure 2400bps modem, DTE rate also 2400.
2400 modem with MNP5 or V.42, DTE rate 9600.
9600-14400 modem, DTE rate 19200
above 14400 modem, DTE rate 38800.

Note 1: your modem may report at Connect
either the link rate or the DTE rate (or both).
You can often adjust this, see modem handbook.

Note 2: Older and slower PC, XT and AT will
almost certainly have difficulty with settings
above 19200 without a [FIFO 16550 UART].@4011
Also faster but multitasking 386 and up will have
problems above 19200 without a 16550.

In general, except for the most basic system,
a [16550 Chip] is to be recommended, and the@4011
switch to activate it can be found under
/Config/Modem.

A selection can be made from a list of the usual
port settings by pressing <F2>, but any sensible
value can be entered manually, eg. 4800.
Any value is allowed, that the serial interface
supports.
Stick to the standard ones, though.

Enter here the number of seconds a telephone unit
gives when calling this server (depends whether it
is local or long distance) both for cheap rate
and normal rate, and how much 100 units costs.
Get these values from your phone book.

Also enter the time it usually takes for this server
between answering the phone and the "connect"
message.  This is to calculate charges correctly.
CrossPoint cannot know when the phone is picked up,
and you start paying. It can only start timing from
the "connect", so it adds this time to connect when
calculating the phone charges.

Time it by turning on the modem's loudspeaker and
timing between the click when the other side picks up
and when the "CD" (Carrier Detect) lamp on the modem
lights up.
The time is between 5 and about 15 seconds usually.

If you are a Sysop, you do not send your netcall by
modem, of course. You transfer it manually from
CrossPoint into the Box Software on the same machine.
You have to tell CrossPoint two file names:

<<Input file>>
The name of the file which CrossPoint has to read
in to "receive" a netcall. <<Note>> after being read
in, this file will be deleted!


<<Output file>>
The name of the file where the puffer with the
outgoing messages should be put.
<<Note>> If this file should already be present,
CrossPoint will hang the new data on the end.
You have to make sure <<yourself>> that this file is
deleted after the data have been transferred into the
box!

As soon as entries are made here, all other types of
modem-point entries (Point, Modem, Charges) will be
ignored and only these 2 files read and written
when a "netcall" is made.

@
183
These are settings if you do not want XP to transfer
the data by modem, but to put or take the prepared
files to or from some place on your hard disk.

<<Input directory>>
This is the directory from which CrossPoint will
read incoming message packets. It imports all packed
or unpacked packets from here and deletes *all* the
contents of this directory afterwards.

<<Output directory>>
CrossPoint puts all outgoing PKT files in this
directory. If you set the "pack output data" switch
the packets will be packed (amazing!). You can
transfer these packets to this mailbox by some other
method, or do anything else you want.
<<Note:>> CrossPoint will not delete these files
so make sure they are deleted as necessary!

See also the chapter in FIDO.DOC, "Sysop Mode"

@
8035
<<Input Packets>>
Enter the path and name for the QWK packets, which
XP should import for a /Netcall/Single operation.
eg.
   C:\INBOUND\*.QWK


<<Output directory>>
This is the directory where XP will put the REP files
with the reply messages.
@
8036

These are settings if you do not want XP to transfer
the data by modem, but to put or take the prepared
files to or from some place on your hard disk.

Note that XP expects and issues UUCP file names in a
particular form. In most cases it will be necessary
to rename them. See also the documentation UUCP.DOC.

<<Input directory>>
This is the directory from which CrossPoint will
read incoming message packets. It imports all packed
or unpacked packets from here and deletes *all* the
contents of this directory afterwards.

<<Output directory>>
CrossPoint puts all outgoing PKT files in this
directory. If you have entered a packer under
/Edit/Servers/Edit/Point, the files will be packed.
You can transfer these packets to this mailbox by
some other method, or do anything else you want.
<<Note:>> CrossPoint will not delete these files
so make sure they are deleted as necessary!

See also the chapter "Sysop Mode" in UUCP.DOC.

<<Start Program>>
You can enter here the name of a program or
DOS command which will be started at the beginning
of every Sysop-Mode netcall. This is important if
the files to be imported have to be prepared
in some way (eg. several copied together).

<<Endprogramm>>

This program is analog to the above, but started
surprise surprise at the end of a Sysop-Mode netcall,
for dealing with those cleaning up tasks.
@
184
<<[x]>> ->  A report about the netcall will be
        put in the newsgroup /¯NetCall, as usual
        for "normal" netcalls.

<<[ ]>> ->  No report will be generated.
@
185
<<[x]>> ->  CrossPoint does <<not>> add details of
        the server to messages from you in the out-
        going packet. The sender only appears as your
        Username. This is sometimes necessary to
        avoid problems when importing to Zerberus(r).

<<[ ]>> ->  A normal, full username with box details
        is added.
@
186
<<[x]>> ->  Outgoing Mail Packets will be packed with
        the Packer entered under ../Edit/Point.

<<[ ]>> ->  Outgoing Mail packets not be packed, but
         left as unpacked PKT files.
@
187
<<MausNet:>>

Enter here your Login Password.

<<All Other Nets:>>
Enter here the password you use for logging on On-
Line, not as point. It can be the same password, but
it does not have to be.

If you don't enter your password here, you will have
to log on by hand.
@
188
You can decide a name for the log file that logs
proceedings on-line, that CrossTerm opens auto-
matically. Otherwise the Log File must be opened
- if desired - by hand with <Alt-L>.

If no path is given, the file will be opened in the
Log File directory as entered under /Config/Paths.
@
189
You may enter up to 4 time periods, where Netcalls
are *not* allowed in this Server, and of course XP
will not allow netcalls during these periods. Periods
which extend over midnight (00:00) have to be split
into 2, up to midnight and after midnight.

Entries can be deleted with <Ctrl-Y>.

Ask your Sysop at which times point netcalls are
permitted.

This setting has no effect on the Sysop-Mode.
@
198
<<[x]>> ->  This box will be included when calling
        [/Netcall/All]@11502

<<[ ]>> ->  This box will *not* be included when calling
       [/Netcall/All]@11502
@
199
A program that CrossPoint will call after getting the
packet but immediately before importing the messages
into the data base.
Using the macro $PUFFER the name of the file about to
be imported can be given to this program.

Its most frequent use is to comb the file with a
filter program, which can treat mails in various
categories in various ways (throw out messages from
known idiots, sort out messages of special
interest), but it can be anything you want.

Notes:

þ  You can start a batch file.

þ  The program is called, even if no messages came
   in. In this case the name of an empty puffer will
   be passed. An empty ZConnect puffer is 0 bytes,
   an empty Z-Netz puffer up to 8 bytes (4 CR/LF)

þ  It works in Sysop Mode too.

þ  To filter external format packets in their
   original form (Maus, MagicNET etc.) you should
   combine the filter program in a batch file for
   the unpack operation.

You can enter a box here, which XP will enter as the
server for new newsgroups (automatically entered),
instead of the box they actually come from. This is
useful for example if you prefer to reply always over
a particular other box, where you perhaps poll more
often.

Note that this feature in some nets is only usable
under certain conditions. The newsgroup must also
be in the substitute box, and you must be allowed to
write to it *in that box*. In Fido for example, you
are only allowed to write to areas you subscribe to.
But in UseNet and Z-Netz it is a useful feature.

Also note, that this setting does <<not>> affect news-
groups already there! To change the server for par-
ticular newsgroups, you can use
/Re-Org/Misc./Change Server.

@
8033

You can enter a box here, which XP will enter as the
server for new newsgroups (automatically entered),
instead of the box they actually come from. This is
useful for example if you prefer to reply always over
a particular other box, where you perhaps poll more
often.

It is not only possible to do this in one net, it is
also possible to divert between ZConnect and UseNet,
or even from ZConnect and UseNet to Maus Net.

Note that changing this setting does <<not>> change
user already in the address book. To change these use
Re-Org/Misc../Change Server.

@
190

This is the pure name of the server, without further
details, which is used for addressing this box from
*inside* of the local net.

Note that changing this entry does not automatically
change the entries in newsgroups and users to match:
You have to change these entries separately through
/Re-Org/Misc../Change Server.
@
191
<<MausNet / Fido:>>

Enter your name here.

<<all other nets:>>

This is the name under which all your messages will
be sent out. It is your "address name" for the out-
side world. Do not confuse you Username with your
point name. Your point name is only relevant inside
your server for holding message packets for you.
Set your Point Name under /Edit/Servers/Edit/Point.

If you should write under several names in a box,
as Sysop or perhaps as point with several different
Users, you can set the current username to be used
with the *SETUSER command.

See also the chapter about "multi-user points" in the
manual.

@
192

You can enter some suitable comment here, the full
name of the box, the place or whatever, up to 20
characters.

<<Fido:>> You should put the name of your server
box here.
@
193
This is the name of the program in the server which
deals with your requests to subscribe to or cancel
newsgroups, sends you lists of available newsgroups
and so on. Depending on which net, and the box soft-
ware, use one of the following names:

<<Z-Netz>>  MAPS     for Zerberus and Euromail
        AREAFIX  for AlphaNet 2000
        REQUEST  for Edgar

<<Fido>>    Areafix or Areamgr, ask your Sysop.

<<MagicNET>>    MAF (possibly also SYS-MAN)

<<GS-Mailbox>>  SYSTEM

<<QuickMail>>   Enter the name of the Sysop. There is
        no automatic system, you just inform the
        Sysop of your wishes.

If in doubt, ask your system operator (Sysop).

(For more about domains: see XPOINT.DOC, Ch. 1.3).

<<ZConnect:>>
Enter the name of the domain to which your server
belongs. It will be something like: "zer.de" or
(for Comlink) "comlink.de", or "saar.sub.de"
("de" means Deutschland, the other parts are
subdivisions)

<<UseNet:>>
Enter the domain as it appears in your own address.
If you are "abc@def.sub.org, then the domain is
"sub.org".

<<Seven:>>
Enter the international domain under which the server
is to be reached. usually ".seven.sub.org"


<<MagicNET:>>
Enter the normal pseudo domain for these systems,
(usually ".magic" or ".pro")

(Technical note: The MagicNET domain is only entered
in the message-ID.

<<Fido:>>

In this box you can put:
a) nothing
b) the name of the net to which the box belongs,
   eg. "fidonet" or
c) the full domain of the server, eg. fidonet.org

Upper/Lower case is unimportant.

This field is at present fairly unimportant, but
you should NOT enter some fantasy domain that is
not "proper".

If you enter something here, you should also attach
it to AKA addresses you may have entered,
eg. 2:345/678\@fidonet.

(Technical note: The Fido-Domain is only used in the
Message-ID).

A name, a witty saying, anything, but short.

You can enter a separate origin for each defined
Newsgroup group. TAB-key from normal newsgroup
display to edit mode, then EDIT.
@
197
Enter the full Node address of your server (Boss-
Node) in the form Zone:Net/Node .

Note: If you change the node address, you have to
change the Server Setting for all areas belonging
to the changed server.

<<Groups>>

CrossPoint can administer an unlimited number of
Groups of Newsgroups. Each Newsgroup belongs to
one and <<only one>> Group. For each group, there are
individual settings for things like maximum message
size, special character conversion and signature.
The idea of this is mostly to allocate Groups to
different Networks, so you can adjust the settings
to suit the requirements of each Network but you
may, of course, use them for any purpose.

<<Display in "Groups" Window

   1     Internal             IBM             ì
   2 Q S Local                IBM             ì
   3  K  Net                  IBM   Ú    20.000

   ³ ³³³ ÀÄÄ Group name       ³     À max. Message

   ³ ³ÀÄÄ K = Header is set   ÀÄ Character set
   ³ ÀÄÄÄ Q = Quote template is set
   ÀÄÄÄÄÄ Group number (automatically allocated)

Note: The "ì" character denotes there is <<NO>> limit
      on the message size!

<<Standard Groups

<<Internal>> This is for messages that will <<NOT>>
        be sent out. Example:  /¯Netcall

<<Local>>   Messages for your local Server only,
        which will not be sent further into the
        Network.

<<Net>>     General Network Newsgroups

You can, however, create as many new groups as you
wish and define them as "local" or "net", with
different settings. There is only <<ONE>> "internal"
group.

<<New>>     Defines a new group.

<<Delete>>  Deletes the selected group.

<<Edit>>    Edits the selected group.

<<Fido>>    Edits Fido-specific settings for a group.

<<OK>>      Exits this function.

Note: CrossPoint allocates the group numbers
sequentially. If you delete a group, the number is
NOT reallocated. A future XP version may, in the
interest of environmental protection, allow the
recycling of numbers.

@
201
You may select any name for the newsgroup name.
It will be shown in the group overview and when
editing newsgroups.
@
202
This is a size limit you can set for messages in this
group. Some nets/newsgroups have rules about message
sizes. If you exceed this size with a message, XP
displays a warning in the send-off window, and
also puts a "!" next to the size when the message is
displayed as "outgoing"

To set NO LIMIT, enter 0 (zero) here!
@
203
This is the "standard" message hold time for this
group, which will be automatically suggested and
set if you do not specially set it otherwise.

To set NO TIME LIMIT, enter 0 (zero) here.

The exception here is PM newsgroups, which always get
a zero as standard value (which can of course be
changed).
@
204
Sets how the special characters (ASCII 128-255) will
be handled in <<outgoing messages>>.

<<IBM>>     Uses the IBM character set, all characters
        from the keyboard are passed on into the net.

<<ASCII>>   Translates //////á in ae/oe/ue/Ae/Oe/
        Ue/ss. This is required by Fido, subnet, Maus-
        net for example.

<<ISO>>     translates //.../á into the character codes
        according to ISO 8859. This standard is un-
        fortunately not yet supported in any net, but
        may appear soon in Subnet to start with.

@
205
These are the file names for the message templates:

o Header-Template (<<Head>>, Default: HEADER)
o Quote-Template (<<Public Quote>>, Default: QBRETT)
o Signature (Default: SIGNATUR),

which XP will use when writing to newsgroups in this
group. All template files end in XPS, but do NOT
enter this extension, XP does it itself.

If any of the fields are left empty, then XP does not
use anything for that template, except for the
Quote template, which then uses the standard
QBRETT.XPS

The templates can be edited by editing their res-
pective files selected under /Edit/Templates/
/Head, /Public Quote /Signature

Editing is done with any text editor.

You may also write self defined templates, with any
file name you wish (extension must remain XPS though)
and edit them and /Edit/Templates/Misc

<<Re^n:>>  When answering a message, a ["Re:"] will be@4012
        put in front of the subject. If there are
        "Re's" already there, they will be gathered
        together into ["Re^n"]. So instead of Re:Re:Re:@4012
        as is sometimes seen, Re^3 will appear.

<<Re:>>     A single ["Re:"] is put in front of the@4012
        subject, regardless of what is there already.
        This may produce "Re:Re:Re:" lists, if some
        are already there.

<<none>>    Nothing is put in front of the subject.
        Existing Re:'s will be removed.

<<Default>> The setting set under
        /Config/Options/Messages will be used.

Press <<F1>> for further information about [Re:]@4012

See also under <</Config/Options/Messages>> for the
default setting.

As a rule, use "Re^n" for Z-Netz, "none" for Fido.

Note: This setting does not affect UseNet or Mausnet.
In Mausnet nothing is added to the subject, in
UseNet always only a simple single "Re:" is used.

@
209
Choose a newsgroup group, or abort with <Esc>.
@
210

Enter here the character you wish to use as the
[quote character]@4013

The usual and recommended character is << > >>

When you quote-reply to a message with <Ctrl R> or
<Ctrl P>, or when you use /Message/Forward/QuoteTo
or /Message/Extract/As_Quote, the message you are
replying to is inserted in the editor with the quote
character at the beginning of each line, to show that
it's quoted.

You may use any combination of characters you wish
(but see info [quote character])@4013

Note: spaces inserted after the character count as
part of the character, to allow it to be separated
from the text (or not) as you wish.

If you wish, CrossPoint will insert the initials of
the person being quoted in the quote character.
To achieve this use <<\@>>.

P.MANDRELLA    gives  PM>
FRANK_MUELLER  gives  FM>
GHOSTWRITER    gives   G>

You can also use <<$>> instead of "\@" and then no
initials are produced for names with no divider.

@
211
At this column, a new line will be started for
quoted text. This is necessary because the quote
sign increases the line length and lines which
were previously readable become too long and
unreadable if the same lines are kept with the
quote sign at the beginning.
@
212
When messages are imported into the data base at each
netcall, the user names are read. CrossPoint can put
previously unknown names into your user list
automatically, and this setting decides which ones.

Note: persons to whom you send a PM are also
automatically put in the list.

<<All>>     Puts all users in the user list.
            (Use with care)

<<Z-Netz>>  Puts only users whose addresses contain
        no ":" or "%" signs into the user list.
        That stops users which have come over gates
        from other nets being registered.

<<PMs>>     Puts only Users who send you a PM into
        your user list.

Except under special conditions, PM's is the only
sensible setting. Otherwise over time you get simply
thousands of users in your list, 99% of whom you
never have any cause to address. Persons you send
messages to are put in anyway.

You can put any user specially into your list while
looking at their message in the message window, with
Ctrl-U.

@
8068
New Users will be placed in this
[Addressbook group]@8069

@
8069
Addressbook groups:

This allows the User-window to be sorted
alphabetically into Groups. Groups with lower
numbers will not be sorted, whilst Groups with
higher numbers will be placed at the end of the
User-list.

Valid numbers are in the range 1 - 99

@
213
<<[x]>>     CrossPoint will buffer its program data,
        particularly for a DOS Shell, in EMS. About
        200 KB is needed.

<<[ ]>>     CrossPoint will buffer its program data
        to the hard disk, to the directory entered
        under /Config/Paths as TEMP directory.
        It will also do this, if no EMS is available.
        This is rather slow (unless you use a RAM
        disk as TEMP location), but you may have no
        option.
@
214
<<[+]>>     Set this if you occasionally like to
        test the Quit function but not actually quit
        the program. Confirmation will be requested
        before quitting and you can either confirm or
        abort.

<<[ ]>>     For real men! :-)

        Quits the program immediately with no
        questions asked.
@
217
<<Archive prefix

Which archive newsgroups should be displayed for
selection when a message is selected for archiving
with either /Message/Forward/[Archive] or <Alt-A>.@12109

You need only enter the first part of the name and
all matching names will be shown.

If left empty, you may select from ALL newsgroups
for the archive.

If your <<internal>> archive newsgroups are called:

       /A/General
       /A/EMAIL
       /A/Programs
       /A/Texts

then entering <</A/>> here will cause these
newsgroups only to be displayed for selection.

@
218
<<[x]>>     Messages sent to [Archive] will be set to@12109
        "delete" to avoid storing them twice.


<<[ ]>>     Message will be left as it is.

@
8070
<<[x]>> -> Insert a note at the beginning of the
       archived message text.

<<[ ]>> -> Do NOT insert a note at the beginning of
       the archived message text.

<<Explanation:>>
            If enabled, a note will be inserted at
            the beginning of the archived message
            with details of the date and the original
            message area.

<<Example:>>
        You decide to archive a message in /FIDO/TEST
        A note will be placed at the beginning of the
        archived message text, thus:

        ### Archived message on <date>
        ### Origin : /FIDO/TEST

@
219
<<[x]>>     New newsgroups which are automatically
        entered because a message for them appears,
        will be put at the end of the newsgroup list
        in the window.

<<[ ]>>     They will be entered alphabetically into
        the appropriate place in the list. This is
        the standard setting.

At the end is best though, otherwise you just don't
notice new groups if they get one message that you
don't happen to notice when it is new. You get into
the habit of always looking at the end for new NGs
@
220
<<[x]>>     Incoming PMs are put in a NG with your
        full user address as its name.

<<[ ]>>     Incoming PMs are put in a Newsgroup with
        only your user name as name.

In this way you may have separate PM NGs for
different nets, or have all PMs from everywhere
put into the same NG.

Note: This does not work in the old Z-Netz format,
since the box name does not appear in the address.

@
221
<<[x]>> -> When configuring new areas with Ctrl-H,
       with [/XPoint/Import/Newsgroup list] or with@11004
       [/Message/News manager/Subscribe] (only ZCON-@11901
       NECT and RFC/UUCP), area descriptions will be
       taken from the arealist and written to XP's
       Newsgroup (Areas) window.

<<[ ]>> -> Area descriptions will NOT be added!

You can manually add an area description
with /Special/Edit.

@
222
<<Fido, QWK, RFC/UUCP:

<<[x]>> -> Activates umlauts for new Users in the
       User-list.

<<[ ]>> -> Umlauts are NOT activated and will be
       converted to ae, oe, ue.

This option can be manually edited by pressing the
<Tab> key from the newsgroup (areas) window and then
selecting <<S>>pecial/<<E>>dit.

Note: For all other Networks, umlauts are displayed.

@
223
This option determines how the User-window will be
sorted:

<<[x]>> -> It will be sorted initially by Server, then
       by User-name.

<<[ ]>> -> Sorted by User-name.

This option may be manually toggled in the
User-window by pressing "O".

@
224
Some users use the "|" and ":" characters as a quote
character instead of the more commonly used ">"
character. When either of these other characters are
used, they may be recognised (or not) as valid quote
characters here and "colour quotes" will be used,
just as they would for the ">" character.

@
225
You can set a level for minimum free hard disk space
which must be available when XP <<starts>> (what
happens cannot be controlled). If the space available
is less than the limit, a warning is given.

The minimum is 1MB. You should set here <<at least>>
3 times the size of the largest Netcall data quantity
you expect to receive, but better set a much higher
value and make space available, at least until you
know what you are doing.

Problems through the hard disk suddenly being full
in the middle of data handling always lead to
unrecoverable loss of data.
@
230
CrossPoint does have its own built in lister, (for
reading messages) which should do all you need.
But if you really cannot part from your beloved old
lister, then you can enter it here (incl. extension
.COM or .EXE)

The macro <<$FILE>> may be entered for the name of
the file to be listed. Otherwise XP passes the file
name as the only parameter to the lister.
@
231
Enter here how many kilobytes memory your lister
requires as a minimum. CrossPoint then attempts to
make this much memory available when starting the
lister.
@
232
Note: This is only an option for the internal lister.
When using an external lister, the full screen mode
is always used.

<<[ ]>>     The message is displayed within the
        boundaries of the normal XP window.

<<[x]>>     Switches to a full screen display for the
        lister when presenting a message to read.
@
233
<<[x]>>     Lines in reality longer than 80 charac-
        ters will be folded for display into lines
        of 80 columns.

        However, since this splitting occurs before
        TAB characters are expanded, lines containing
        TABs can end up longer than 80.

<<[ ]>>     lines will not be folded until column 255

<<[x]>>     Messages with [reference] links are indicated@4014
        in the status bar of the lister with an
        <<arrow>> whose direction shows whether the
        other messages are "upstream" or "downstream"
@
235
<<[x]>>     The message header will be shown fixed
        at the top of the screen; does not scroll
        with it.

<<[ ]>>     The message header is shown as part of
        the message, and scrolls with it.

With a fixed message header, a light coloured back-
ground looks best (set in /Config/Display/Colors
/Lister/Message Header) with the separator line
removed at the end (set in /Config/Display/Header).
(Or separators top and bottom).
@
236
In Z-Netz or MagicNET, only Umlauts in IBM character
format are permitted. Unfortunately many programmers
for non-IBM computers ignore this, and this leads to
strange "Amiga characters" (actually characters to
ISO 8859-1) like "ä" for "" and "ö" for "" etc.
appearing in messages.

Setting this switch on <<[x]>> converts these char-
acters in the lister and for quotes into the editor
into their IBM equivalents. Unfortunately the "Ä"
cannot be converted (to "") because it is so often
used in its true IBM graphics form for lines.
@
237
It is common to indicate emphasis on words by en-
closing them in *asterisks* or _underlines_.
This switch causes CrossPoint to take words with
these characters at each end and show them in a
different colour, which you can set in:
/Config/Display/Colors/Lister.

<<[x]>>     XP shows these words in the different
        colour.

<<[ ]>>     XP tells it like it is.

You can toggle this setting at any time (if you want
to take off the rose coloured spectacles) by pressing
the key <<C>> (for Colour).
@
238
<<[x]>>     If you are using mouse support, this
        switch puts a scrollbar in.

Specify up to what size binary files that you have
marked to send will be copied into CrossPoint.

It saves space when files above this limit are
saved in XP simply as a "to be sent" remark with
a note where the original is, which is sent at
netcall time. But there is a catch:

Encoded Messages are also binary files. If you
set the limit too low, encoded messages may get
lost through being saved as a "to be sent" remark
and a path to a (subsequently) non existent file.

Setting zero "0" here sets no limit; binary files
of any size will be stored complete.

The standard hold time which is set by default for
newly entered Newsgroups, when they are added with
"new" in the newsgroup editing mode.

For new newsgroups added automatically when something
comes, the default setting for the group where it is
put is used. This setting is done under /Edit/Groups.
@
242
The standard User hold-time is used as the default
for the time that messages will be held in a User-
newsgroup, when a new user is entered through "new'
in the User Editing mode.

@
244
Normally the exact date and time of you writing the
message is stored and displayed publicly with the
message. However you may not want people to know
exactly when you sit at your computer.

<<[x]>>     set on, this switch puts the time as 00:00
        on all your outgoing messages.

<<[ ]>>     set off, the correct time is recorded.

The correct date of writing, (assuming your
computer's date is set correctly), will always be
recorded.

CrossPoint will, by default, put one of the forms
of [Re:] for you onto the subject of messages you@4012
are replying to.

Here you can decide for the default setting between a
simple "[Re:]" always being added, or gathering the@4012
["Re:"s together].@4012

See also under /Edit/Groups/Edit, where the Re:
can be set individually for newsgroup groups, and
even switched off (not possible here).

<<[x]>>     (switch with <space>), make Re^n
<<[ ]>>     just a simple Re: on the front of whatever
        is there.

Note: This setting does not affect UseNet or Mausnet.
In Mausnet nothing is added to the subject, in
UseNet always only a simple single "Re:" is used.

<<ZCONNECT, UUCP/RFC:

You have to set the correct Time Zone here.

For Germany this would be:
    <<W+1>>   for Winter time
    <<S+2>>   for Summer time

For New York it would be:
    <<W-5>>   for Winter time
    <<S-6>>   for Summer time

So when you change your system clock, don't forget
to change this setting, to ensure your postings
appear with the correct time stamp.

W or S stands for Winter time or Summer time, and the
number is the number of hours from GMT (Greenwich
Mean Time), the + or - showing whether in front or
behind.

Note: if you have the 00:00 switch set, not only does
this setting have no effect, you don't even see it!

Which types of messages allow CrossPoint to advertise
itself as the point program used:

<<always>>  on all messages.

<<AMs>>     only public messages.

<<PMs>>     only private messages.

<<never>>   well, never :-(

Note: this setting is only allowed for the [registered]@6
version of CrossPoint.
In Fido XP always advertises its presence, in MausNet
you can switch it off for PMs.
@
248
<<[x]>>     Messages aborted (with <Esc>) at the
        send-window stage will be sent to the news-
        group ¯Unsent (this is the same as if you had
        deliberately selected "Park" in the send-
        window). From here you can send it after all
        if you change your mind again, using:
        /Message/Forward/Repost.

<<[ ]>>     The Message is really discarded when you
        abort it with Esc. As long as you have not
        written anything since, it can still be found
        in the TEMP directory as the file LASTMSG.

Do not confuse such discarded messages with those
"outgoing" because they have not been sent yet, but
are waiting for the next netcall, and are marked "!".
@

<<[x]>>     If CrossPoint receives a message with a
        subject beginning with "\##", it sends a
        a confirmation message automatically to the
        sender. The same applies to Fido Messages
        having a return-receipt flag.

<<[ ]>>     CrossPoint does not respond.

A receipt confirmation can be easily done by hand,
with [/Message/Forward/Confirmation].@12106

You can enter a line here which will appear in the
header of ZCONNECT and UseNet messages. You can use
this line for your company name, if you use
CrossPoint commercially, or for similar information.

In FidoNet, this line is transmitted in the EMSI
packet as the name of your system. If this line is
left blank, CrossPoint transmits your Username as
your system name.
@
1041
<<At present, only ZCONNECT:>>

You may give your postal address here; the individual
lines must be separated by semi-colons.

This address will be sent in the header of all
ZConnect messages, and can be seen publicly using
suitable software.
@
1042
<<At present, only ZCONNECT:>>

You can enter your telephone numbers here. The
numbers should have the following format, and must be
separated by a space:

Ident letter+country code-dialling code-number[Q]

eg.
   V+49-1234-56789     (Voice-Number)
   V+49-1234-56789Q    (Voice with answering machine)
   F+49-1234-56789     (Fax-Number)
   B+49-1234-56789     (Mailbox Number)

For combined functions, you can put more than one
ident-letter thus:

    VFB+49-1234-56789Q

for a line with one of those funky Japanese handies
with a fax-capable answering machine function in its
mini-disk based Mailbox.

The numbers will be sent in the header of all
ZConnect messages, and can be seen publicly using
suitable software.

The directory where CrossPoint should put the
temporary files which it uses.

CrossPoint uses many temporary files; when writing
messages in the editor, when displaying messages in
the lister, and so on. These are all immediately
erased after use, but must be somewhere while in use.

It is a good idea to use a RAM Disk for this if you
can, it makes it a lot quicker.

You <<must>> make certain, that there is enough space
on the drive given for the temporary files. It should
be at least 200-300KB, more if you send long
messages.

If nothing is specified, CrossPoint uses the same
directory as the one the program files are in.

@
261
The extract-directory is where CrossPoint puts the
files which are extracted with /Message/[Extract].@10302
However, at each extract, the file name is requested,
and another directory can be specified.
@
262
The "send" directory is the default one where Cross-
Point puts files which are to be sent (if you decide
to send a file). Also the files for Auto-Send
messages are kept here.

It is the default; in all cases you can also specify
another directory individually if you wish.
@
263
Specify here the directory where CrossPoint should
put log files. The following files are affected:

   XPOINT.LOG     Log for telephone charges.
   ERRORS.LOG     Errors log (no, really?)
   BRETTER.LOG    logs Newsgroups which CrossPoint
                  automatically adds
   USER.LOG       logs Users which CrossPoint
                  automatically adds
   DUPES.LOG      the results of /Re-Org/Dupekill
   XPFIDO.LOG     Happenings for Fido-Netcalls

It is also the default directory for log files for
the integrated terminal program CrossTerm.

If you no longer wish to read the contents,
you may delete log files; CrossPoint starts
them again from new.

@
264
CrossPoint puts the files here that you get through
[Fido Requests] or [UUCP-File-requests].@13101 12001

You may decide whether special newsgroups
(eg. internal) and PM Newsgroups are displayed
with a "/" in front or not.

It seems pretty unimportant, a matter of taste.

Specify when the divider lines in your newsgroup
overview should be displayed:

<<[x]>>     Always displayed where you have set them.

<<[ ]>>     If you switch (with "A") to showing only
        newsgroups with messages as defined by the
        "View" conditions, the dividing lines are no
        longer displayed.
@

Normally, all newsgroup names in Zerberus compatible
nets are displayed in upper case. If you don't like
this, you can choose between 3 methods of display:

<<normal>>  /Z-NETZ/RECHNER/IBM/ALLGEMEINES

<<special>> /Z-Netz/Rechner/Ibm/Allgemeines

<<small>>   /z-netz/rechner/ibm/allgemeines

This setting also sets the User display.
@

<<[x]>>     UseNet-Newsgroups are displayed in the
        usual UseNet form with periods.

<<[ ]>>     All Newsgroups are shown in the usual Z-Netz

Note: This setting applies to display only; when
entering newsgroup names you must always use the
Z-Netz form (as in /Alt/Tasteless/Jokes).
@

<<[x]>>     The message date will be displayed in the
        message overview.

<<[ ]>>     The message date is not shown. You get

        subject line.

You can toggle this option any time in the
message window with <<<Ctrl-D> >>.
@

Set here how the sender address for messages should be
displayed:

start-up. It can be changed any time by pressing
<Ctrl-N> when viewing the contents of a newsgroup.

Changes to this setting here are only effective on a
new start.

Some nets differentiate between upper and lower case
for user names. "\" characters (escape characters)
are put in front of all upper case letters when
converting to Z-Netz format.

For display, CrossPoint can convert these addresses
back to their original form.
For this you need to enter the full names of the
gates  which use such conversions:
eg. \@UUCP.ZER @MAUS.ZER

For gates where "\" shows lower case and not upper
case, you also need to put a "+" in front, as in
"+\NAME". At present, however, very few gates seem to
use this method.

present, configuring. The standard addresses are:

COM1 3f8
COM2 2f8
COM3 3e8
COM4 2e8

(COM3 & COM4 are quite often not installed)

For COM1 & COM2, the addresses are nearly always
standard.

Note that your hardware (serial interface) also has
these settings and that the settings <<MUST>> match.

The hardware settings may also be adjustable.

Note that your hardware (serial interface) also has
these settings and that the settings <<MUST>> match.

The hardware settings may also be adjustable.

COM3 and COM4 can be difficult. It may be necessary
to learn more about addresses and interrupts to get
them to work.

These commands will be sent to the modem <<BEFORE>> every
Netcall, regardless of which Server you are calling.
It is the default init string and will be sent before
the Server-specific init string as defined in
"/Edit/Servers/Edit/Modem". Consult your modem
handbook if you are not sure what commands should be
sent to initialise your modem.

The preset is:

    ATZ\\AT S0=0 Q0 E1 M1 V1 X4

    AT   = Attention (starts every command)
    Z    = Recall stored profile0
    S0=0 = switches Auto Answer-Mode off
    Q0   = Show result codes
    E1   = "Command echo" on
    M1   = Loudspeaker until connect
    V1   = Verbal result codes
    X4   = Recognise dial and busy tones

It is sensible to find the settings that suit your
situation best and store them in one of the modem
profiles (usually AT&Wx). It can include the above
and others, then you need only reset with: ATZx
instead of typing it all in.

Having this default setting and a Server-specific
setting allows flexibility.

If you wish to send a <CR> to the modem, you can
put a "\\" in the line. After this a new AT will be
necessary before carrying on. eg. ATE1\\ATS13=32.
This is usually not necessary as all the commands can
be strung together after one AT but occasionally, a
modem will need a <CR> after certain commands, before
it is accepted properly.

@
293
These commands will be sent to the modem <<AFTER>> every
Netcall. The command should begin with "AT", as is
usual for Hayes commands.

This is for resetting the modem to some default or
other condition after the Netcall, if, for example,
a special command was used before the Netcall.

If you wish to send a <CR> to the modem, you can
put a "\\" in the line. After this, a new AT will be
necessary before carrying on. eg. ATZ\\ATS0=0.

@
294
This is the dialing command for the modem and is
automatically inserted prior to the telephone
number.

Possibilities are:

   ATDP     for Pulse dialing
   ATDT     for Tone dialing

@
295
If enabled, the modem will pause between dialing for
the length of time that you have specified in
"/Edit/Server/Edit/Modem".

If disabled, the modem will pause for 5 seconds
between dialing.

@
296
<<[+]>>     Ignore state of CD (carrier detect).

Most modems indicate a correct connect by switching
the CD line "high" and lighting the CD light on the
modem. CrossPoint detects this and can reliably
determine that a connect has been detected.

If, however, your modem does *not* normally send this
signal for some reason, or maybe your modem cable is
not so good, XP would normally disconnect because CD
is "low".

This switch causes XP to carry on, regardless of the
state of CD.

Note: CD provides information for XP and if XP has
to get by without it, errors could occur which would
otherwise be recognised.
You should attempt to get the CD recognition to work.

For Fido Netcalls, the CD function <<MUST>> work
correctly anyway.

@
297
<<[+]>>     Ignore state of CTS (Clear To Send).

The modem switches the CTS line to show the local
computer that it is ready to receive data from it
(the modem is clear for the PC to send).

If this signal is not possible, probably because the
wire in the cable is not connected (as is the case
with some cheap cables), setting this switch will
bypass it and tell CrossPoint and the PC to send data
when *it* wants to, regardless of what the modem may
be doing.

Note: especially with slow rates (up to 2400bps),
this missing signal can lead to characters sent to
the modem getting lost, with unpredictable results.
You should attempt to get the CTS to work.

@
298
To help eliminate CRC errors, enable this option.

@
299
<<All Net types EXCEPT Fido

<<[x]>>  Use ring signal line
<<[ ]>>  Ignore ring signal line

If an incoming call (ring signal) should occur while
CrossPoint is pausing between Netcalls, CrossPoint
will delay the Netcall for up to 5 minutes.

(Note, if CrossPoint tries to make a Netcall when
somebody is calling, it will effectively answer the
phone, which will probably cause difficulties all
round!)

If the ring signal line is not connected, as is the
case with some cheap modem cables, CrossPoint will
incorrectly report an incoming call, so this function
should be set to "ignore".

Tip: Get a decent modem cable :-)

@

A FOSSIL driver is a TSR program which, under DOS,
takes over the job of controlling the ComPort,
leaving an application programme less work to do.

Since they take over the job of controlling the Port,
IRQs, Addresses, [16550 UARTs] and so on, all these@4011
options are switched out of CrossPoint if this option
is set.

For normal modems, XP has its own Port driver which
is just as good as any Fossil, so leave this option
off. Especially under OS/2, you should leave it off.

You only need to use it if you wish XP to talk with
something exotic, like an ISDN card, a serial port
on another network machine or if you are experiencing
problems with throughput and/or CRC errors.

Tried and tested DOS fossil drivers include X00,
BNU and ADF.

@
961
<<[+]>>      Use the 16550 UART

Note: there must be one if you set this switch!

If the port (COMx) you are using on your serial
adapter card has a [16550 UART], this setting will@4011
cause CrossPoint to use it.

Make sure the modem is using it, and not the mouse!
(the mouse has no advantage whatever from it).

There are a few obscure versions of this chip which
CrossPoint does not recognise. If you have one of
these, CrossPoint will not use it.

@
962
The FIFO trigger level relates to 16550A UARTS.

Possible trigger levels are 2, 4, 8 and 14. The
default setting of 8 is normally sufficient and
works well in most cases. However, with multi-tasking
OS's, a higher value may be needed.

CrossPoint does have its own built in editor which
should do all you need. But if you really cannot part
from your beloved old editor, then you can enter it
here (incl. extension .COM or .EXE)

The macro <<$FILE>> may be entered for the name of
the file to be edited. Otherwise XP passes the file
name as the only parameter to the editor.

<<Linking in other tools
If you use the internal editor, but wish to call a
program *after* it, perhaps a text formatter or a
signature generator, then you can also enter it here,
but put a <<*>> in front of its name.

<<[x]>>     When starting a message (no quotes), XP

        ready for you to "write on".
        This does not work on editors which flush the
        keyboard buffer on start-up.

        file name for editing.

<<[ ]>>     CrossPoint suggests "*.*", and shows all
         files in the send directory.
         ([/Config/Paths/Send-Directory).@262
@
307
<<[x]>>     CrossPoint starts the editor in 25 line
        screen mode.
This setting may be useful if you have set another
line mode [/Config/Display/Lines] for normal display@10905
@
310
<<[x]>>     The screen mode is switched to 25 lines
        when shelling to DOS with <F9> or from the
        menu with [/XPoint/DOS]@10105

<<[ ]>>     When doing the above, the lines stay the
        same as set for the normal CrossPoint display
       [/Config/Display/Lines].@10905

This option is only functional for EGA and VGA
display adapters.
@
311
Tell CrossPoint to make extra memory for the
environment available (tech. note: uses the /E switch
when calling COMMAND.COM).

You do not need to use this if you do not know that
you need extra environment space.

See your DOS handbook for more information about the
environment.
@
400
The name of the newsgroup. Each newsgroup name must
begin with "/" and may be up to 80 characters long.

Note that some Zerberus compatible systems only cope
with up to 40 characters, therefore in Z-Netz news-
group names longer than 40 chars are not used.
@
401
You can put a comment about the newsgroup here, which
will be displayed in the overview.
@
402
All messages that you write into this newsgroup will
be sent to this server.

With <F2> you get a list of servers to select from.
@
403
Messages will be held this many days.

When they get older than this, unless they are set to
"hold" will be set to "delete" and will be at the
next Re-Org. Counted from the date received.

If you have set "Msgs" in the next field, this number
becomes the maximum number of messages allowed in
this newsgroup. Older messages are set to delete, to
keep to this number if it is exceeded.

A "0" here means the messages will kept forever.
Only intentionally deleted messages will be removed
by a Re-Org.

@
404
Days or number of messages.
You can specify here whether the number entered for
the hold time means days or the number of messages
held.

Messages older than the number of days, or the oldest
messages above the set quantity will be set for
delete at the next Re-Org.

Messages over a time limit are displayed with a "."
marking to show this. It is not possible for
technical reasons to indicate messages exceeding the
number (if set) count in this way.
@
405
<<[x]>>     Messages from users who have been set to
        filter will be automatically erased from the
        newsgroup.

<<[ ]>>     Messages in this newsgroup are nor
        filtered.
@
406
Each newsgroup belongs to a newsgroup-group.

See under /Edit/[Groups]@200

The group must be selected from the list called with
F2
@
407
Enter here the "Origin" line that CrossPoint should
put under each message you write to this area. If you
leave it empty, XP will use the default Origin for
that area group (see /Edit/Groups). If there is no
origin entered there, XP will use the default origin
entered under /Edit/Servers/Edit/Names.

Note that for technical reasons there cannot be an
origin and simultaneously a stand-in entered for an
area.
@
409
You have selected (marked) several newsgroups. All
changes made will affect all marked newsgroups.
@
410
All messages which you write to the selected
newsgroups will be send to this server.

<F2> brings up a list of servers to select from.
@
411
How many days messages will be held, or how many
messages will be held in the marked newsgroups.

Messages older than the number of days, or the oldest
messages above the set quantity will be set for
delete (if you do not set them specially to hold,
with "H"). Counted from the date of receipt.

0 sets the hold time unlimited.
@
420
The complete name of the user, including full
address.

Note, even for users in your server box, you must
give the name of the box.

For Fido-Users you can enter only a part address, and
have CrossPoint get the rest from the NodeList. A
Node List must of course be active for this.
@
421
Enter a Stand-In address for a user. If for example
you get mail from Smith@BoxA.sb.sub.de, and also from
the same user John@BoxB.zer.der, but always wish
replies to go to BoxA, enter Smith@BoxA.sb.sub.de as
stand-in address for John@BoxB.zer.de.

The stand-in address must be a complete and valid
address.
@
422
You can enter some comment about the user for your
own benefit, or, for users (not cc groups) you can
enter a pseudonym in the form:
      <<P:Name>>
If, when CrossPoint is putting in a template, it
finds the macro $PSEUDO, it will look to see if a
name is defined here, and put it in here if it is.

This enables you to put somebody's real name in, if
XP cannot deduce it from their user name.
(Otherwise XP will use it as if it were $TUSER).

$VPSEUDO works the same, but XP puts $VORNAME in
instead of $TUSER if there is no entry.
@
423
Messages to the selected User(s) will be sent to this
server. Use <F2> to get the list of your servers to
select from.

Note: if you have entered an address in another net
type as stand-in address for this user, you must
enter the server for that net here.
@
424
This users messages will be held this many days. All
older messages not specially set to hold with "H",
will be set to delete ready for the next Re-Org.
Counted from the receipt date for the message.

0 sets the hold time to unlimited.
425
<<[ ]>>     Umlauts written by you to this user will
        be converted automatically (to ae, oe etc.)
@
426
<<[x]>>     Public messages from this person will be
        left out when reading in the Puffer (Dumb
        User Filter). PMs are NOT affected by this
        setting.
@
429
You have marked several users. Changes made now will
affect all of them.

Changing the server or comment will apply also if
cc-lists (carbon copy) are marked.
@
430
These marked users messages will be held this many
days. All older messages not specially set to hold
with "H", will be set to delete ready for the next
Re-Org. Counted from the receipt date for the
message.

0 sets the hold time to unlimited.
@
431
<<[x]>>     The message filter will be activated for
        all marked users or newsgroups. This means
        that messages from users with activated
        filter will not be sorted into these news-
        groups.

<<[ ]>>     The filter is switched off for all marked
        users and newsgroups.
@
432
<<[x]>>     The marked newsgroups are write-prot-
        ected, and cannot be written to.
        This does the same as the "Read Only" switch
        under the Menu option "Access" in "Special"
        mode in the newsgroup window. It stops you
        writing by mistake to newsgroups you are not
        allowed to (your server would reject them).

<<[ ]>>     You can write to this newsgroup.
@
440
This is the text which will be shown in the "Tools"
menu(or in the function keys list at the bottom of
the screen), to show you the function you have
programmed. In the Tools menu, if you put a "^" sign
in front of a letter, this letter will be the hot-key
to start that tool. You may leave this field empty,
if you really want to.

For example ^PC-Tools will display as <<P>>C-Tools
and pressing "P" will start it.
@
441
This is the command to start the program.

There are two possibilities;

  a)  an external DOS Program
  b)  an internal XP-Function

<<External Programs>> are any .COM, .EXE or .BAT
program. They should be in the XP directory, in the
DOS Path or you enter the full path to them. COM &
EXE programs will be started quicker if you specify
the extension as well.

You can pass parameters (if needed) to these programs
in the normal way by specifying them after the
command. You can use the <<$FILE>> macro to pass the
current file name.

For example, if you are specifying the Archive-Shell
SHEZ, you can enter here SHEZ.EXE $FILE. Now,
whenever you have an archived Message selected, you
can select this "Tools" menu option, and SHEZ will be
started, showing you the details of the file you had
selected.

<<Internal XP Functions>> are started by putting a
"*" first, then the XP command.
For example *list errors.log will show you the
contents of the errors.log file in the lister.

These functions are NOT available in the CrossTerm
terminal program.

<<*>>       alone does nothing, unless you have the
        AUTOEXEC switch on, when the AUTOEXEC
        directory will be executed.

<<*LIST "File">> loads the file into the lister
             (internal or external, depending which
             you have set) for you to read.

<<*EDIT "File">>   as for the Lister, but to for the
               editor.

<<*NETCALL BOX>>  makes a netcall at the given Box.

<<*RNETCALL BOX>> Does a re-login Netcall.

<<*REORG>>        Does what the menu function
              [/Re-Org/Messages] does.@10701

<<*SETUSER BOX NAME (Realname)>>
        Sets your Username/Real Name for the
        specified box to the specified name.
        This can be useful if you write in a box
        under several names. If you leave NAME empty,
        it will be asked for each time.
        The (Realname) is optional and only relevant
        for ZConnect, RFC/UUCP and MagicNET anyway.

@
442
The format in which the message will be passed to
$FILE. The same formats are available as in
/Message/Extract:

<<without header>>  Messages Text only, or the binary
            contents as applicable.

<<with header>>  Message incl. Header.

<<Puffer>>       File in Zerberus Puffer format.

<<Quote>>      File in Quote-Format; The template for
           QBRETT.XPS will be used (/Edit/Templates
           /PublicQuote).
@
443
<<[x]>>     XP tries to produce a valid filename out
        of the Subject line to pass to $FILE.

<<[ ]>>     XP uses a temporary File name.
@
444
<<[x]>>     After ending a called program, XP asks
        you to press a key before the program's
        display disappears.

<<[ ]>>     The CrossPoint display returns
        immediately.

Note: if you expect to see something displayed by
this program, and it all just flicks back to the XP
display, try setting this switch.
@
445
<<[x]>>     When a program is started, the complete
        screen is cleared.

<<[ ]>>     Only the main XP window is cleared.
@
446
<<[x]>>     The output of the started program is
        redirected to the lister for reading. This
        only works when the program allows
        redirection, as all DOS commands do.
        If in doubt, try it out.

<<[ ]>>     The output appears on the "normal"
        screen.
@
447
<<[x]>>     When the program has finished, CrossPoint
        actions the [AUTOEXEC] directory.@4019
       Entering only <<*>> for the program name plus
       this switch starts no program, but does action
       the AUTOEXEC directory.
@
448

Enter here how many kilobytes memory the program
requires as a minimum. CrossPoint then attempts to
make this much memory available when starting the
program.

If your PC does not have EMS or a RAM Disk available
for fast swapping out of unused XP data, this option
is useful to minimise the time required for swapping.
@
450
The start date for the statistic. Messages dated
earlier will not be included.
@
451
The end date for the statistic. Messages dated later
than this will not be included.
@
452
<<[x]>>     When comparing dates, the message date
        (of writing) will be used.

<<[ ]>>     The receipt date will be used.
@
453
<<[x]>>     Only messages in marked newsgroups will
        be included and evaluated.
        (Mark Newsgroups with <Space> )

<<[ ]>>     System statistic: All Messages not in
        local or internal newsgroups are included.

        Newsgroup statistic: All NGs are included.
@
454
<<[x]>>     The results of the analysis will be send
        to the internal newsgroup /¯Statistic for
        reading (and storing).

<<[ ]>>     The results are shown in the Lister only.
@
455
Well what do you suppose?
@
460
This list serves 2 purposes.

For holding <<Z-Netz>> and <<UUCP>> servers where you
can then order files using
[Messages/Fileserver/Request]@12001

For holding agreed passwords for <<Fido>> boxes for Crash
Mails.

The following information is displayed:

 FP  BOXNAME       Comment
 ³³  ³             ³
 ³³  ³             ÀÄÄ some useful comment
 ³³  ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ Name of the box
 ³ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ there is a password entered
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ F = System is a Fileserver
                       U = System is UUCP-Fileserver

Systems are displayed in alphabetical order.

<<New>>     Allows entries for a new system and
        details.

<<Delete>>  Deletes the selected system.

<<Edit>>    For editing the details of a system
        already in the list (similar to "new")

<<OK>>      Closes the window.

@
461
<<Z-Netz:>>  The System (Box) name; up to 8 capital
        letters.

<<UUCP:>>    The System (Site) Name; this system must
         also be entered under Edit/Servers as a UUCP
         server.

<<Fido:>>    The Node address in the form Zone:Net/Node.
@
462
Any helpful text you wish.
@
463
<<Z-Netz:>>
Fileservers function in a similar way to 'maps (the
maps that deals with your subscribing and cancelling
newsgroups). It is addressed just like a user, and
the commands are in the subject line. Put the name
given to the fileserver (if there is one, there isn't
always) here. It is often FILESERVER. <<Ask your Sysop.>>

<<UUCP:>>
Select with <F2> "UUCP-Fileserver". In this way
CrossPoint knows that this system supports UUCP
file transfers.

<<Fido:>>
Leave this field empty.

@
464
<<Z-Netz:>>
Password for SERVICE command.
Some fileservers offer extra services which are
called by the command SERVICE (see also /Message
/Fileserver/[Service]. This requires the password@12005
you enter here. It is NOT necessary for ordering
files!

<<Fido:>>
If you have a password with this Fido Box or Point
for making direct calls (see [/Fido/Crash]), put@13104
that password here.

<<UUCP:>>
If the UUCP site in question has a file-list file
put the name of that file here. It is usually called
"index" or "contents", "FILES" or something similar,
often with "~\" in front, eg. "~\index".
CrossPoint uses this when requesting lists with
/Message/Fileserver/Lists/Request

@
465
<<Z-Netz:>>
This box has no meaning for Z-Netz.

<<Fido:>>
This field has no meaning for Fido.

<<UUCP:>>
You can enter an external program here which Cross-
Point should use to convert the list to a CrossPoint
conform format when reading-in file lists obtained
from the fileserver. The name of the input and output
file *must* be passed using the macros $INFILE and
$OUTFILE.

@
469
Select the required system and press <Enter>.
<Esc> aborts the operation.

All Z-Netz fileservers are shown by an "F" in the
first column. UUCP fileservers with "U".
This marking can be changed with /Edit/Systems/Edit.
@
470
Select the required printer port.
@
471
This setting causes a page-wise formatting of the
printer output. If 65 lines are entered for example,
CrossPoint sends a form-feed every 65 lines to the
printer.

If you want NO form feed at all, enter a 0 here.
@
472
This character string will be sent as printer code to
the printer before every print job. You can use it to
reset the printer, or set fonts, formats or whatever.

Control Codes ASCII 0 to 31 can be entered in the
usual notation for <Ctrl-x> by preceding them with
the caret "^" sign, thus: <Ctrl-[> for ASCII 27 (Esc)
is "^[". The caret sign itself can be produced with
"^0".

You can also enter the ASCII number direct using a
prefix "##", eg. #27 for Esc. A single "#" is
achieved using "^#".

@
473
This character string is sent to the printer after
every printer job.
Entered as default is a form-feed ^L (=Ctrl-L)
@
474
This character string will be sent to the printer at
the end of every page (after every x lines you have
set)
Usual is the form-feed Ctrl-L (ASCII #12) ^L
@
475
Left Margin (no. of characters); 0= no margin.
@
480
Enter the password here with which messages to and
from the selected user can be coded. You can decide
each time when you send a message, whether to code it
or not.

<<Important>> when using pmCrypt passwords are passed
as DOS parameters. They *must* not contain any
spaces, "/" or other DOS separators.
@
481
Set the coding system (if any) that you have agreed
with the selected user.

<<QPC:>>  A simple and fast system developed by
      ZIMAC\@HIT.ZER. It is supported by many Z-Netz
      programs.

<<DES:>>  A very safe system, but designed only for
      exchange of messages between CrossPoint users.

<<pmCrypt>>  (pmc-1 to pmc-3): A system developed by
      Christian Mock for linking in any external
      coding program. The program being used must be
      set up under [/Config/External/pmCrypt)]@12405

@
482
<<[x]>>  Default for these users in the Send-Window
      is  "code". When sending messages, if you just
      press <Enter> to send it without changing
      anything, it will be coded (assuming you have
      set up a coding system).

<<[ ]>>  Default "do not code"
@
490
You can enter up to 3 external coding programs,
linked in to CrossPoint through the pmCrypt system.
The entries are as follows:

<<Name:>>
The name of the coding process. It is only a
description for you, it is not used.

<<Encode:>>
The name (call) of a program (or batch file) which
will ENcode a file (put it into code). CrossPoint
will put the message to be encoded as the temporary
file CRYPT.MSG (in the TEMP directory). The result of
the actions of the called program must leave a
(coded) file CRYPT.ENC in the same directory.

The following macros can be used to pass information
to the program:

<<$INFILE>>   =  <TempDir>\CRYPT.MSG
<<$OUTFILE>>  =  <TempDir>\CRYPT.ENC
<<$KEY>>      =  the code key (Password)
<<$USER>>     =  Name of the recipient of the coded
                 message

<TempDir> stands for the directory you entered under
/Config/Paths as the temporary directory.

<<Decode:>>
The name (call) of a program (or batch file) which
will DEcode a file. CrossPoint will put the message
to be decoded as the temporary file CRYPT.ENC (in the
TEMP directory). The result of the actions of the
called program must leave a (decoded) file CRYPT.MSG
in the same directory.

<<$INFILE>>   =  <TempDir>\CRYPT.ENC
<<$OUTFILE>>  =  <TempDir>\CRYPT.MSG
<<$USER>>     =  Name of the sender of the coded
                 message


<<binary  [x]:>>
This switch sets the result of the coding operation
to be send as a binary file (like sending other files
as binary messages).

[ ] sends a text file as a normal message.

Since the encoded messages are not formatted like
text, this switch should normally be set to send them
as binary files.

ONLY set this switch off, if you can (and wish to)
produce a proper ASCII text file from the encoding
procedure.

This can be useful, because some nets do not allow
binary files, and they must be converted to ASCII
files in a special form. The net will probably do
this, but you can avoid extra work for the net.

PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) can do this for example
with the switch -a)

þ XP will check the message and set it to binary
  anyway, if it contains non-text characters.

þ If the recipient uses THE ANSWER or another point
  program which *requires* the binary form when
  receiving messages for the pmCrypt system, so you
  must also use binary for sending.

<<Example 1:>>

Let us suppose you wish to use a (fictitious) program
called SUPERKEY, which has the following syntax:

encoding: SUPERKEY <Source> <Result> <Key> code
decoding: SUPERKEY <Source> <Result> <Key> dec

Then enter the following:

Name:       SUPERKEY
Encode: SUPERKEY $INFILE $OUTFILE $KEY code
Decode: SUPERKEY $INFILE $OUTFILE $KEY dec

<<Example 2:>>

PC-DES (the internal XP cipher) expects the password
to be entered from the keyboard. A trick using the
DOS echo command achieves that when PC-DES is set up
to run under pmCrypt.

Name:       PC-DES
Codierer:   echo $KEY|PC-DES $INFILE
Decodierer: echo $KEY|PC-DES $INFILE

The program is not called, it is XP internal anyway,
but this activates it automatically and feeds it the
password.

@

Enter the year for which the charges statistic should
be produced.
@
501
<<[x]>>  the charges overview will be put into the
     Statistic newsgroup (and kept).

<<[ ]>>   the statistic will be displayed in the
      lister (then deleted).
@
502
<<[x]>>  CrossPoint produces a detailed graphical
     day by day monthly report as well as the year
     report.
@
503
Sets the vertical scaling for the monthly graphic.

Default is 2. If you have high charges set a higher
end value, so that the higher values fit on the
chart. 1 gives sufficient detail if you have just a
few units per day.

<<Timing-List edit>>

Each timing list can have up to 100 entries. The
following functions are available:

<<New>>     Enter an additional, new activity.

<<Delete>>  Delete an activity from the list.

<<Edit>>    Edit the existing, selected entry.

<<Active>>  Toggle whether the entry is active or
        not.

<<Save>>    Save entries/changes.

<<OK>>      Exit the Timing-Editor.

Entries are sorted into order according to time
and displayed as follows:

There is more in XPOINT.DOC under "automatic
Netcalls".

@
520
Enter here the start and end times for the period
during which the activity will be attempted.
For example 10:00 to 11:59 for a netcall will mean
CrossPoint starts attempting a netcall at 10:00, and
if not successful, will give up at 11:59.

If it is successful earlier, it stops anyway and does
no more in this period.

The end time may be before the start time, in which
case CrossPoint will make 2 activities out of it.
 "11:00-10:00" would be handled as:
 "00:00-10:00" and "11:00-23:59".
@
521
^^520
@
522
Enter the start and end dates for the activity.
The activity will not be attempted before the start
date or after the end period.
During this period, behavior will be regulated by the
weekday entry and the time-of-day entries.

<<[ ]>>  The mouse is initialised once at program

Depending on hardware and mouse driver, this
initialising can take time, so don't use it
unnecessarily. But if you find the mouse behaves
strangely after DOS calls, try this switch.

This is the double-click speed for the left mouse

<<[ ]>>   <Esc> just takes you back up one level.

If you often have to search for a setting in /Config,
switching the full escape off is good. Otherwise you
keep having to start right at the top of the menu
each time, and forget where you were.

For experts who know exactly where everything is,
having to close all menus one at a time can be
tiresome, the big jump out is easier.

<<[x]>>  The welcome screens displayed by systems
     being netcalled are displayed (for doubting
     types who are not convinced that something is
     happening).

<<[ ]>>  The welcome screen will not be shown.

This setting can be useful for debugging, if the
log-in does seem to have problems.

It has no effect on Fido-Netcalls.
@
561
<<[x]>>  CrossPoint attempts to cut short the welcome
     screen (by sending <Breaks>), to save time.
     Sensible if you do not see the welcome screen
     anyway! This is specially useful for servers
     with extensive welcome screens which take a long
     time.

<<[ ]>>  CrossPoint does not interrupt the welcome
     screen.

It has no effect on Fido-Netcalls.
@
562
<<[x]>>  Use Hayes commands for the modem. Nearly
     all (if not all) modern Modems use the Hayes
     command set, a standardised set of commands for
     telling modems what to do, typified by the "AT"
     command (ATTENTION) at the start of every
     command, also called AT command set.

With almost 100% certainty, this switch should be on
as above!

<<[ ]>>  It is highly unlikely that your modem does not
     use Hayes commands (unless it is defective ;-),
     but old things like acoustic couplers may come
     into this category. This turns them off.

     If you feel this is for you, you are on your own
     as far as ensuring that the correct commands are
     sent. You probably need to delete the modem init
     command under /Config/modem/ and maybe set the
     switch under /Config/Modem/../ignore CD.

This setting has no effect in Fido Netcalls.

@
563
<<[x]>>   If a netcall should be prematurely
      interrupted, the received CALLED file (what
      there is of it) will be renamed and saved.

<<[ ]>>   According to ZERBERUS(r)-Standard, the
      rubbish will deleted and received again at the
      next netcall.

This may be set off <<[ ]>> to avoid
wasting space when you have confidence in your
system. The server should not delete a netcall
packet which was not fully sent, and will keep it to
send again anyway. Trying to import damaged or
incomplete puffers is not easy.
See also [ERRORS.LOG]@4021

If you set it on, remember to clean out the old
renamed CALLEDs now and then.

@
564
<<[x]>>  Incoming message packets are deleted
     immediately after being imported. This saves
     disk space.

<<[ ]>>  Incoming packets are deleted at the *next*
     netcall. This means that a safety copy of the
     last packet is available in this time. This can
     be useful for instance if the conversion from
     packets from other nets to ZConnect format
     (which XP always does) should go wrong.


If you have space, leave the backups until the next
netcall. If your space is very tight, set the switch
and delete immediately.

This setting has no effect on Fido netcalls. Here a
backup always remains available in the SPOOL
directory until the next netcall.

In "Sysop mode", the puffers are always deleted
immediately after being "sent", ie. transferred into
the mailbox.

@
565
<<Z-Netz:>>

<<[x]>>  Lower case user addresses in incoming
     netcalls are converted according to Z-Netz
     guidelines to upper case.

<<[ ]>>  Addresses are not changed.

There is no clear cut recommendation here. Probably
better is "on" ([x]), but then check that messages
from you to users with lower cases addresses (which
have then been converted to upper case) do get
through.

@
566
<<[x]>> In addition to the log-file entries at the
    end of netcall-reports, a full log of the netcall
    will be put in the file NETCALL.LOG in your
    Log File directory (see /Config/Paths).


<<[ ]>> No additional entry in NETCALL.LOG

This setting has no effect on Fido netcalls, which
have their own log files.
@
570
Enter the subject for the message.
@
571
Enter the name of the file to be sent. You can select
the name by pressing <F2>. Default is the SEND
Directory (see /Config/Paths). You can also select
your way through other directories to find
files.

You can also enter NO filename. In this case XP
produces a message consisting of an empty line. This
can be used for example for sending MAPS commands,
(where the command is in the subject) perhaps
regularly to order a newsgroup list.

@
572
Enter the User or Newsgroup to which the message
should be sent. Make sure you enter it correctly, it
will not be checked for plausibility.

With <F2> you can select from the list.
@
573
You can specify to which one of your Servers the
message will be passed.
Usually you leave it empty and CrossPoint uses the
default server specified in the settings for that
user or newsgroup, or, failing that, your main
server.

To send Fido crash mails, enter CRASH here.
@
574
Specify which days the message should be sent.
Separate days with commas. Eg. entering "1,15" will
send the message on the 1st and the 15th of the
specified month (see entry field 'month").

This field may also be left empty, or used alone or
in combination with "weekdays" and "Date1/2".
@
575
You can enter the weekdays, separated by commas, on
which the message should be sent. Mo,We will send
the message every Monday and Wednesday.
@
576
Specifying  months here (eg. 1,4,7,10) sends the
message only in those months. "All" sends it in all
months.
Specify Days or Weekdays for the days in those months
when the messages are to be sent.
@
577
<<[x]>> If it is a binary file

<<[ ]>> Normal Text files.
@
578
<<Delete>>
This entry is only effective when the Date 1/Date 2
fields are in use, but the "days" and "weekdays"
fields are empty. In this case the list entry will be
deleted when the message has been sent. It enables
the sending of one shot timed messages, without your
having to delete the timing entry afterwards.

If the message file has the extension .MSG, it will
also be deleted.
@
579
<<[x]>>  The file will only be sent, if the file date
     has changed since the last time.

This switch works in combination with all other
settings, but of course has no effect on messages
where no file is specified..

If the file is to sent each time it changes, there
<<must>> be a "day" or "weekday" entry
eg. "weekdays = all" to allow it to be sent.
@
580
A single complete date can be entered here, on which
the message will be sent. The date will be deleted
after sending. If the fields "days" or "weekdays" are
also empty, and the field "delete" is [x] "on", the
complete entry will be deleted, plus the message if
it is a .MSG file. See the field [Delete]@578

Normally, every message you send is given a unique
identification number, the message ID.

MagicNET did not use to use them, but they are used
in Seven-net now and even in MagicNET. Leave this
switch on unless you know differently.
@
651
The name of the Magic-compatible net.
@
652
MagicNET and Maus messages are sorted in into XP as
sub-newsgroups to this name.
"/" puts them all on the top level, in case you only
poll one net, and don't need the identification.

E.G.

/MAGIC/  ->   /MAGIC/Allgemeines
              /MAGIC/Dfue
              /MAGIC/Virenforum

/        ->   /Allgemeines

/MAUS/    ->  /MAUS/Ibm
              /MAUS/Maustausch
              /MAUS/....

<<Note!>> If you change this, you *must* change the
names of ALL newsgroups in it.

In MagicNET this takes effect only after a new
newsgroup list has been imported.

@

Enter here which type of point you have in the
server, "point" or "box". If in doubt ask your sysop.

@
655
<<Z-Netz / ZConnect

<<[x]>>  Your messages are given the sender address
     Username\@Pointname.

<<[ ]>>  Your messages are given the sender address
     Username\@Boxname.


The second form is normal, according to ZConnect
standard. Set the switch "on" only if you know it is
correct, or your sysop says so.

<<UUCP/RFC

<<[ ]>>  Your messages are given  the sender address
     Username\@Pointname.domain

<<[x]>>  Your messages are given the sender address.
     Username\@Servername.Domain.
     This form is very unusual. If you have it, using
     this switch saves you from having to specify a
     stand-in address.

@
656
You can set a stand-in ("Reply-To") address for your
messages. All PM replies to your messages which you
send over this server will be redirected to this
stand-in address (as long as the person answering has
this capability).

Stand-In addresses must be complete domain
addresses in the form "User\@system.Domain. You may
put your real name in brackets on the end, eg:
      user\@system.do.main (Forename Surname)

must not be, the same as your Session Password (Point
Password). Put your Session Password here unless you
agree something different with your sysop (boss).
@
702
The general format is the same, but some area
managers need a "+" sign in front of the name or the
Area being subscribed, in the text of the ordering
message. Some don't.

Generally "AreaMgr" uses "+", AreaFix gets by
without.
As usual, ask your sysop if in doubt.
@
703
Some area managers get their orders direct from the
subject line, some from the message text.
Usually, AreaFix uses the subject line, AreaMgr uses
the text.
As usual, if in doubt, ask your sysop.
@
704
If your BossNode uses the D'Bridge Mailer and
messages to AreaFix are not accepted, enable this
feature. However, if messages to AreaFix are
accepted, do NOT enable this feature.
@
705
If the server offers a File Manager (Filescan), you
can put its name and password here. Get the password
from your sysop. It can be, but must not be, the same
as your session password (point password), and/or
your Area Manager password.

This is a newsgroup header for this server, under
which all newsgroups are put as sub-newsgroups.
Put /FIDO/ here, for example, and an Areas PASCAL.GER
will appear as /FIDO/PASCAL.GER.
A simple "/" puts no header.

<<Note>>: if you change this, you <<must>> change the
names of all affected newsgroups to match.

Enter the dialling prefix used in your country for
making international calls. In Germany it is "00"
@
721
Enter the prefix you use when making long distance
inland calls. In Germany and many other countries
this is "0". You tend not to notice because it is
always given as part of the area code ("0681" is
really "0"  plus "681" area code)
@
722
Enter your own dialling code, without the "0" but
with the international code for *your* country from
outside. Germany is 49, so if you are in Saarbrcken
in Germany ("normally" 0681), enter 49-681.

If CrossPoint is to use a point list in POINTS24 or
4D format, but it's not actually the standard point
list for region 24, then you must enter here the file
names and the Diff file names (without extension)
to be expected. Make sure the setting for the
point list type ("4D point list") is set correctly.

Standard-file names for the point lists in the 24 Net
are POINTS24 and PR24DIFF.

<<[x]>>  When a node or point list is active, setting
     this switch enables automatic updating when new
     Diff files arrive. Be sure that the ARC unpacker
     in  [/Config/External/unpacker] is available.@12404


<<[ ]>>  Diff files have to be manually unpacked,
      by selecting commands from the menus.

Diff files stay in the FileReq directory until
deleted by hand, even when they are automatically
imported. (FileReq see /Config/Paths)
@
726
<<[x]>>  All in-going messages with 0 Bytes will be
     deleted.

This switch is intended for users who receive all
message packets as File Attaches (see FIDO.DOC).

It saves deleting the empty messages by hand.
However, for normal use, it means in-going File
Attaches go unnoticed.
@
727
If you subscribe to file (as opposed to message)
areas in a Fido box, very often the files sent are
accompanied by so-called TIC-files, with the
extension .TIC, which contain brief information about
the file they accompany.

<<[x]>>  CrossPoint uses these files and puts the
     information in a newsgroup areas created for the
     purpose, giving a good overview of files
     received. The TIC files are deleted.

<<[ ]>>  TIC-Files are put like all other files in
     the FileReq directory  are not specially
     handled.

(FileReq see /Config/Paths)

@
728
All Fido Area Messages are addressed to someone, even
if only "everybody". If you write a new message to an
area ("W" in the Area window), the entry here will be
suggested as default "recipient". It is usual to put
"All" here, for general messages.
@
729
<<[ ]>>   The point list to be imported has the
      POINTS24 format usual in Germany.

<<[x]>>   The point list has the 4D format. This
      format is the most widespread, and is used also
      in many [Fido-Compatible nets].@4009

Note: It is important to set this setting <<before>>
you import your point list. If the setting was
wrong, the NodeList must be re-indexed using
/Fido/Nodelist/Index.
@
730
Enter the node address or the name of the sysop of
the box where you wish to request or deposit files.
The Sysop name can be in the form:

        Forename Surname
        Surname, Forename
  or    Surname

If you wish you can enter only part of the name.
@
735
Enter the list of files that you wish to request,
names separated by spaces. You can request password
protected files by appending the password with a
slash "/" to the file name.
Wild cards are allowed

Eg. to request POLICY.ARJ, XP920.EXE & a file
POINTS.* protected with password SECRET, enter

POLICY.ARJ XP920.EXE POINTS.*/SECRET

If you have a file list for the box in question, and
it has been imported ([/Fido/File List/Import])@13201
you can call up the list with <F2> and mark entries
in the usual way ("m" for the cursor and <space> to
mark)

When you finish selecting, <Enter> transfers the
selection to a request list in the request window.
<Esc> aborts.
@
736
<<[x]>>  The request is started immediately.

<<[ ]>>  The request is stored and can be
     started later manually with [/Fido/Crash]@13104
     or automatically with an entry REQUESTS in a
     timing list (/Netcall/Timing List/Edit), or
     through [Netcall/Single], if the request is@11501
     directed at your Boss Node.
@
738
Enter the list of files you wish to send. For files
which are NOT in your SEND directory (see below), you
must enter the complete path.
[/Config/Paths/Send directory]@262

The Send request will be stored. The actual sending
is done with [/Fido/Crash].@13104

Files to be sent to your boss node should be sent via
a netcall rather than a crash.
@
740
Enter the Node Number or the name of the Sysop or
Point that CrossPoint should dial.
@
750
Enter the Number or of the Node or Point (in the form
Zone:Net/Node.[Point] )about which you want to look
up information. Alternatively you can reference the
name of the sysop or point. If you leave off the Zone
and even the net, CrossPoint assumes these from your
main Fido box.

The line "Flags" contains various information about
the node and its modem type.

The most important are:


<<Modem>>    V32  = CCITT V.32, 9600 bps
         V32B = CCITT V.32bis, 14400 bps
         HST  = USR HST, 14400 bps
         H16  = USR HST, 16800 bps
         PEP  = Telebit PEP, bis 18000 bps
         MNP  = Error correction MNP
         V42  = Error correction CCITT V.42
         ZYX  = ZyXEL 16800 bps

<<Mail>>     CM   = 24 Hours
         MN   = no packed (ARC) mails possible

<<FileReq>>  XA   = all types of File Request
         XX   = only Requests to WaZOO-Standard

(CrossPoint supports WaZOO-FileRequests).

@
760
Enter the name of the server from which the
message packet comes, or the name of a box with the
same net type, or select one with <F2>.
@
761
<<[x]>>  CrossPoint sets the date of receipt as
     being the date the message was written. This
     is necessary to ensure that the newsgroup
     hold time works properly when larger, older
     mail packets are imported.


<<[ ]>>  Date of receipt is set to current system date.
@ 762
<<[x]>>  Answer Receipt Requests when importing. For

<<[x]>>  The statistics are written to the internal
     newsgroup /¯Statistic.

<<[ ]>>  The statistic is only displayed in the
     lister, and not kept.
@
771
<<[ ]>>  Nodes, which are registered in the Node
     List as "down" are not included in the
     statistics.

"Down" Nodes are temporarily not reachable.
They must go on-line again within 14 days or they are
removed from the node list.
@
772
How many of the largest nets should be included in
the statistic (top 10, top 50 etc.), up to a maximum
of the top 100.

     Even users with addresses in the old Server.

<<[ ]>>  Only users in whose address the old Server
     does <<NOT>> appear are changed to the new
     Server.

     ie. local USERS\@OLDBOX are NOT changed to the

Setting this option deactivates convert addresses
into upper case letters as they are typed in.
You need this in nets with case sensitive addresses.

If you use this, switch off the address upper case
conversion under /Config/Options/Netcall
@
791
<<[x]>> when using CrossPoint exclusively in Z-Netz.

<<[ ]>> using CrossPoint in other nets as well.

Set this switch off!
This setting causes ".ZER" to be attached
automatically user names as they are entered, and in
upper case if that is set to on too. Z-Netz does not
use the ".ZER" address any more, but uses exclusively
domain addresses.
@
792
<<[x]>>  Public copies of a ZConnect message will be
     gathered together into a crossposting.

<<[ ]>> -> ZConnect-"Crosspostings" will only be
       generated for PMs.

See XPOINT.DOC; "Crosspostings".
@
793
<<[x]>>  CrossPoint informs the Maus box when calling
     how much free hard disk space is available.
     Space for unpacking and importing is allowed
     for. If space is tight, the server will send a
     smaller packet.


<<[ ]>>  CrossPoint says nothing about free space,
     and the box sends the lot.
@
794
<<[ ]>>  After reading each received PM, you can
     decide whether the message should receive the
     status "gelesen" or "zurckgestellt". The sender
     of the message can see that you have read it,
     and make a guess about what you are going to do
     with it.

<<[x]>>  CrossPoint confirms "gelesen" for all
     messages as they are imported, and stops the
     annoying question. The sender at least knows
     that you have received his message.
@
795
<<[x]>>  CrossPoint requests the "read" status of all
     your PM's at each netcall, and updates the
     status in the internal newsgroup /¯Mausstatus.
     That way you know whether your PMs have arrived.

<<[ ]>>  CrossPoint does not bother. That way you
     save transporting the status information, which
     for prolific writers can be several KB, and the
     time taken to analyse and update the status.
@
796
<<[x]>>  CrossPoint also uses the MIME standard (RFC
     1341 for public messages (news), to signal the
     use of umlauts and other special characters.


<<[ ]>>  MIME is only used for PMs, as its
     specification actually defines. For news
     CrossPoint uses the non standardised lines
     "X-Charset:".
@
797
<<[x]>>  CrossPoint uses a special system called
     "quoted printable" to code umlauts and other
     special characters so that older systems in the
     net can transport them correctly.


<<[ ]>>  Special characters are sent 1:1 (in ISO-8859-1-
      character set).

Set this option OFF, at least at first. "Quoted
printable" is not used by many systems, making your
messages in all the others pretty unreadable.

CrossPoint does however translate INCOMING "quoted
printable" code correctly!

@
798
<<[ ]>>  If CrossPoint receives a "cancel" message,
     it looks for message to cancel and if it finds
     it sets it to "read" and "delete", so it will be
     cleared out at the next Re-Org. The cancel
     message is also set to "read" and "delete"

<<[x]>>  Cancel Messages are imported like all others
     and ignored.

See also [/Message/Forward/Delete].@12107
@
799
<<[ ]>>  All lines from RFC message-headers (see also
     UUCP.DOC) are included in the ZConnect (see
     XPOINT.DOC) header. A "U" is put in front of
     unrecognised lines.

<<[x]>>  Lines not required by CrossPoint and
     ZConnect are excluded from the conversion.
     This saves several hundred Bytes per mail!
     The saving on public messages is however small.

This is the telephone charges list. You can enter up
to 100 different tariff zones and their dialling
codes. The first 2 entries for "long distance" and
"RoW" are defaults, used for calls inland and
internationally respectively, that do not fall into
one of the other defined classes.

 360.00  720.00  (22 Entries)         Local
  60.00  120.00  (76 Entries)         Near Zone

 ³       ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ Seconds/Unit at cheap rate
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ Seconds/Unit at normal rate

In the first line additionally is the price of a
unit. The following functions are possible:

<<New>>       Enter a new charge zone
<<Delete>>    Delete the selected charge zone.
<<Edit>>      Edit the selected charge zone
              (dialling code and time for 1 unit)
<<Save>>      Save changes
<<OK>>        Quit

The latest international charges (at time of writing)
are already entered.

@
804
This is the name for the tariff zone. If there is not
enough room in one window for all the numbers to be
entered, give another window the same name and put
more entries in it.
@
805
This is the number of seconds you get for a unit at
the normal (daytime) rate (usually 8:00 to 18:00) and
the cheap rate.

For example Germany at present (1994):

      Zone           Normal     Cheap

^^807
@
809
Enter a list here of all the dialling codes that
belong to the zone that you are working on. National
codes should be entered including the prefix for
national dialling (usually "0", in the US "1"), eg.
Frankfurt is O69. For international codes, leave off
the prefix for "international" (no "00" or similar!)
but DO put a dash after, ie. Germany is 49-, UK 44-
etc.

Note. When you are finished, you can confirm and exit
with <Ctrl-Enter>. It is not necessary to press
<Enter> repeatedly on blank spaces to reach the end.

Enter which external program CrossPoint should call
for viewing binary files.

<<New>>      Create a new entry.

<<Delete>>   Delete the selected entry.

<<Edit>>     Change an existing entry.

@
821
Enter the Mime-Type of this entry.
(The Mime-Type is the MIME-Header description
of the Filetype (Usenet))

If you select a message with this Mime-Type,
XP will show it with the Viewer-Programm.

@
822
Enter the file extension.

If you select a Binary file or a Fido-Fileattach
with a file of this type, XP starts the viewer-
programm to show it.

Note that in Z-Netz the message subject does not
always contain the correct file name, which makes
recognising file types by name difficult.

Hint:
If you enter a HTML viewer (MIME-Type <<text/html>>)
you should enter <<htm>> as file extension, otherwise
the external HTML viewer might fail in recognizing
the temp file as a HTML file.

@
823
Enter which Programm CrossPoint should call to
view files of this format.

The program must be in the DOS Path for XP to find it.
(or you may enter the path to the programm.)
This program is started as soon as you select a
binary file or a MIME-Meassage, containing a File
of the selected format.

If you give the macro $FILE as parameter, CrossPoint
will put the file name in at this point, otherwise it
gives the file name to the called viewer as the first
parameter.

If you wish to use a batch file to start your viewer,
enter the name of the batch in full, eg. VIEW.BAT.
(ie. incl. ".BAT")

After saving the data base query, you must make a
call to send the query, and another a short time
later to collect the result.
@

You can enter here the name of a newsgroup (or select
from a list by pressing <F2>) where all replies
to your message will be put by CrossPoint. In UseNet
this is called "Follow-up-To".

If replies to your messages written in one newsgroup
should always be sent to another one, you can set
this permanently with the "access" option in the
newsgroup window, "special" view with a stand-in
address.
@
851
You can set a stand-in address to which all PM
replies to your message are diverted. Make sure the
stand-in address is a valid address written in the
proper domain form. If you want you can append your
real name in brackets.

eg.
      userx\@system.do.main (Fred Bloggs)

If you want all PM replies to all your messages to be
sent to the same (other) address, should set up a
stand-in address (/Edit/Boxen/Edit/...) for them.
@
852
You can enter here a list of key words which
characterise the contents of the message. The words
should be separated by commas. These keywords enable
readers of the message with suitable software to
recognise messages of interest to them easily.
@
853
This field is for a short summary of the message.
RFC 1036 (the technical specification of message
structure in UseNet) says that the subject line
should remain unchanged for a discussion on one
subject, to make it easier to find the reference
links by subject line. The summary is a way of
describing how this particular message relates to the
subject.

If and how you use this field is up to you.
@
854
If your message is only for one or more local
distributions in UseNet, you can specify here the
names of these distributions, separated by commas,
eg. "de" for DeNet.

Use this option with care. Some local distributions
are transported over international links (eg. DeNet)
and get cut out by systems outside this area if they
are marked as only local..

Leaving this field blank is the same as writing here
"world".

@
860
You can enter a stand-in address here, to which
messages meant for this newsgroup will be diverted.
This can be another newsgroup or a user address.

If this newsgroup is read only, any messages you
write to this newsgroup will be directed to the
stand-in address. If there is no stand-in address,
writing is simply not permitted.


If the newsgroup is read/write and a stand-in address
is active, there are 2 possibilities:

<<ZConnect, UseNet:>>
All public replies to messages you write into *this*
newsgroup are forwarded to the stand-in. CrossPoint
attaches a reply address for public messages to these
in the same way that you could enter them direct in
the Send Window (special/more).

<<all other nets:>>

All public answers that you write to messages in this
newsgroup are redirected to the stand-in address.

@
861
^^860
@
870
You can set a maximum private mail message size
individually for each net. The left column is for net
mails, the right column for local mails (ie. users in
your server). Set no limit, enter "0".
(QM/GS means QuickMail/GS-Mailbox)

This only sets a warning. The size of mails is
checked, and if over the limit a warning is given.
You can override it. The "local" setting in UUCP/RFC
is usually ineffective; CrossPoint cannot tell from
the address whether it is a local mail.

You find the same setting for newsgroup messages

Enter the name of the file you wish to upload (or
select one with <F2>.

Note that CrossPoint does not make a copy of the
file; it must remain where you said it was until
after CrossPoint has sent it! (be careful with RAM
disks for example).
@

Enter where and under what name the file should be
stored on the target system. For many UUCP systems
simply the file name is enough; for other systems the
complete target directory path must be defined
(usually ~/incoming).

For more details ask your sysop.

You can display the message header in the lister as
you wish:


<<Insert>>  inserts a line not presently displayed.
        (except dividing lines, which can occur any
        time.

<<Move>>    Moves the current line to another
        position. Move the cursor (after pressing M)
        to the position you want the line to appear,
        and press <Enter>.
        <Esc> aborts.

<<Delete>>   Does not display the selected line any
         more.

<<OK>>       Confirm changes and exit.


The lines Sender, Recipient, Subject, Date and Size
should not require further explanation.
This information is available in *all* messages if
you choose to display it. Other lines are displayed,
even if selected, only when the information is
actually in the header (the brackets indicate
information of this type)


<<Path:>>       Shows the route the message has taken
            in getting to you. All nets show this.

<<Message-ID:>> A "unique" message identification;
            sometimes really unique world wide, or
            maybe only fairly locally or for a
            limited time period.

<<Reference-ID:>>  The Message-ID of the message a
               reply is replying to.

<<Maus-PM-Status:>>  the current status of a PM in
                 MausNet; see XPOINT.DOC.


All other lines are only valid for ZConnect and
RFC-Nets (UseNet / "UUCP"):

<<Followup to:>> The newsgroup where public
             replies to a newsgroup message should be
             put.

<<Reply to:>> Address for PM-Replies

<<Copies to:>>   Addresses of other recipients, who
             should get a copy of the message (can
             also be a newsgroup).

<<File:>>        If it is a file to be sent, the
             name and date/time. Optional; a file can
             be received without a name or date/time.

<<Error:>>     Error message from a box program or a
           CrossPoint message converter.

<<Software:>>  The software with which the message
           was produced (or forwarded).

<<Status:>>     Various status information, eg.
            Confirm Receipt etc.

All other lines should be pretty self explanatory.

<<XPoint / Terminal  (CrossTerm)

This is (provisionally) a rather primitive terminal
program. Really, it is only of use for sending
commands to the modem and displaying the modem
responses. But it does work, without frills, and you
can operate on-line in a box with it. Due to a bug,
you cannot, as indicated, exit the terminal program
and leave the telephone line open. It always hangs
up.

(Maybe the bug is fixed now; try it!)

The modem parameters used are those set for your
principal server (if you don't change them on line
with AT commands to the modem).
@
10106
<<XPoint / DOS-Shell

Calls a DOS Shell (put simply, starts a sub-session
of DOS running under CrossPoint). CrossPoint tries to
make itself as small as possible by swapping out
unnecessary data, either to EMS or hard disk.
(See /Config/Options/Misc.)

To return to CrossPoint type "Exit" at the DOS Prompt
as usual for DOS shells.

Note: You may not load any TSRs in this shell. If you
do, CrossPoint will complain and exit!

@
10108
<<XPoint / Quit

Exit CrossPoint. You can set a safety question under
Config/Options/Misc. that asks you to confirm your
unbelievable intent to exit CrossPoint.

Note that there is also a "Quit" option in the menus
in the Newsgroup and User windows.

<Alt-F4> also exits CrossPoint from any one of the
principal windows (assuming you have not re-defined
this key combination).

<<Message / Search

The search menu contains several options for
searching the data base for messages fitting given
criteria.

Found messages are marked, and displayed in a window.
They remain marked until unmarked with <Ctrl-E>.
During the search, you can break off by pressing
<Esc>.

Depending on available memory, the maximum number of
messages that can be marked as "found" (ie. fitting
the search criteria) lies between 2000 and 5000.
@
10302
<<Message / Extract

Messages (or files) can be extracted from the data
bank and written to a file that you can name.
@
10303
<<Message / Outgoing
This finds and marks outgoing messages, so you can
review them, edit them, abort them or whatever.
Useful for checking everything you have written,
before starting a netcall.
@
10304
<<Message / All

Under this menu are various actions which you can
carry out on all messages on display. This can be
messages in a newsgroup, or marked messages that you
are currently displaying.
@
10305
<<Message / Change
This is for editing messages that are NOT waiting to
be sent.

For editing the text of outgoing messages waiting to
be sent, use [/Message/Outgoing/Edit]@10401
@
10306
<<Message / Forward

This menu contains various possibilities for sending
a message in the data base to another person or
newsgroup. Either as a pure copy or as edited and
commented text, if you wish. See on-line help for the
individual menu items.
@
10308
<<Message / News manager
The News manager is the function for administering
your newsgroups with respect to your server,
subscribing and unsubscribing newsgroups, ordering
lists of newsgroups and so on.

In MausNet CrossPoint sends a control message to the
internal Pseudo-User MAUS. In all other nets
CrossPoint sends the message to the address entered
as news manager under /Edit/Servers/Edit/Names.
@
10309
<<Message / Fileserver  (Z-Netz only)
Some servers in Z-Netz offer Points and other boxes
the possibility of ordering files by netcall. To use
this an external Fileserver program has to be
available.

For it to work the following conditions must be met:

- That you are permitted access to the fileserver
  (talk to your sysop)
- that the fileserver is set up under /Edit/Systems
  (see under that menu)
- that you have a file list to order from.

If you do not have a list, order one first with
/Message/Fileserver/List/Request. The list will
arrive as a message, and you read it in by selecting
it in the message window, then selecting
/Message/Fileserver/List/Read message.
(or Read File if you have it as a file)

That entry activates the menu items here pertaining
to the fileserver. You can then order lists of files
and then the files themselves, and so on.

You can order help from the Fileserver with the menu
item /Message/Fileserver/Help

@
10310
<<Message / PGP

In these menus you will find many functions for
working with the encoding programme, PGP.
@
10311
<<Message / Direct

For real men. You can enter an address to send a
message to direct into the window, without looking it
up.

3 entries are necessary;


<<Server:>>    The Server over which the message
           should be despatched. (This only appears
           when you have more than 1 server)
           The first letter(s) of the box-name are
           sufficient.

<<Addressee>>  The name of the recipient. CrossPoint
           completes the name as necessary with the
           address from the User List, or with .ZER
           (not much use now that .ZER is no longer
           used).
           Recipients not in the User list are
           emphasised by emphasis of the word
           "recipient".

<<Subject>>    The Subject line for your message.

You can enter one of the pre-defined [short-names]@11605
as defined under /Edit/Short names instead of the
complete address.

<<Fido:>>  In Fido you can enter a part of the
address and select the correct completion from the
node-list.
@
10401
<<Message / Outgoing / Edit
If you have an outgoing message currently selected,
either normally or in the newsgroup or user window,
you can edit its text with this menu item, and ONLY
this menu item.

Remember to save it completely after re-editing and
confirm in the send window with <Enter> that it
should be sent (assuming that is what you want).
 <Esc> aborts, AND DOES NOT SEND THE MESSAGE.
@
10402
<<Message / Outgoing / Change Send

This lands you direct in the send window for an
outgoing message, so you can change things there, not
in the text.
You can change the subject, server and coding.
@
10403
<<Message/ Outgoing / Abort

If you decide not to send a message which is
"outgoing", ie. waiting to be sent, you can stop it,
abort the send, with this menu entry. The message is
still there, but will not be sent.

If you change you mind again, you can reactivate it
with [/Message/Forward/Repost].@12108
@
10404
<<Message / Outgoing / Statistic

Gives you a summary of the number of messages waiting
to be sent (ie. in the send packet *.PP)
@
10405
<<Message / Outgoing / View

Shows you in newsgroup format the list of outgoing
messages (ie. those waiting to be dispatched).

They can be read like any other message.

CrossPoint does this operation by marking all
outgoing messages waiting to be sent, then displaying
them [/Messages/Search/Marked].@10506
@
10501
<<Message / Search / Text

You enter a search string (text to be searched for),
and CrossPoint marks and displays any messages
containing this string anywhere.
@
10502
<<Message / Search / Subject

You enter a search string (text to be searched for)
for the subject line only. CrossPoint marks and
displays any messages containing this string in the
subject.
@
10503
<<Message / Search / User

You enter a search string (text to be searched for)
in the Sender Name line only. (The string is mostly a
name, of course). CrossPoint marks and
displays any messages containing this string in the
Sender Name.
@
10504
<<Message / Search / Combined

The combined search is a combination of Text, Sender
and Subject search, with extra options.
@
10505
<<Message / Search / Marked(for reply)

CrossPoint searches out and displays all messages
that have been marked for replying to later.

Note: Marked messages in PM Archive newsgroups will
      NOT be found!

Messages which have been marked for replying to later
(indicated by a "w" in the [message window]) can be@4014
unmarked by placing the cursor over them and pressing
"V". By pressing "V" again, the message(s) may be
re-marked.
@
10506
<<Message / Search / Marked

Displays all marked messages (marked by hand or by
CrossPoint through a search) in a list similar to a
newsgroup display. They can also be operated on like
in a newsgroup.
@
10507
<<Message / Search / Clear

Clears the mark from <<all>> marked messages.
<<<Ctrl-E> >> in the message window has the same
effect.
@
10508
<<Message / Search / MessageID

Some Usenet-articles refer to others by their
Message-ID. This option searches for the MIDs
@
10601
<<Config / Options

These sub-menus are for various configuration
options. See the on-line help for the individual
sub-menus for details.
@
10602
<<Config / External

Options for the Editor, message reader and for
entering settings for CrossPoint to use when it
starts external programs and tools (Editor, Lister,
Packers etc.).
@
10603
<<Config / Paths

By default, CrossPoint puts files in the
CrossPoint program directory. For some types of files
you can define here different directories where they
should be kept.
@
10604
<<Config / Display

In the sub-menus here are  the settings for how
CrossPoint should display practically everything.
@
10605
<<Config / Modem

Here, under the sub-menus for each ComPort, you will
find the configuration parameters for the ComPorts.
The settings you enter here will remain constant for
each ComPort. In other words, these are <<global>>
settings. Server-specific settings may be defined
under /Edit/Servers/Edit/Modem.

By this means, CrossPoint can operate with up to 4
modems on 4 ComPorts with unique modem-specific
settings for each one.
@
10606
<<Config / Printer

Printer settings.

At present they apply only to printing messages with
"R", printing with "D" when in the Lister, or when
printing the Help pages with <Ctrl-D>.

The settings are NOT valid when printing from the
Editor using <Ctrl-K><P>.
@
10607
<<Config / Keys
Aside from the 9 entries in the [Tools menu], the@10608
Function keys F1 to F10, in their Shift-Fx, Ctrl-Fx
and Alt-Fx versions can be programmed to start
[external programs]. In this way you have 30 keys@10615
freely programmable.

Select the key combination you wish to use from the
list, select the F1 to F10 version to use from the
next list and press <E> to edit its programming.
<Esc> breaks off the programming without changing
anything. <Ctrl-Enter> ends and saves the changes
immediately.

@
10608
<<Config / Tools

In addition to the menu entry "Calendar", you can
enter up to 9 user-defined [external programs].@10615
Select the position (1-9) you want to edit from the
list displayed and press "E" to edit the settings.
<Esc> breaks off without saving the changes,
Ctrl-Enter exits immediately and saves the changes.
@
10609
<<Config / Save

If you have not set the option "save" to automatic
(under /Config/Options/User Interface), changes made
in the Config (and in /Fido/Options) settings are not
permanent, but last only until CrossPoint is exited.
The old settings are "remembered" and used at the
next start. If you want to keep the changes, you must
save them "manually" using this menu entry <<save>>,
or alternatively at any time by pressing <Alt-S>.

If you have set the "save" option above to "ask on
quit", CrossPoint notes that changes have been made,
and asks when exiting the program, if you want to
save.

Exceptions are the colour settings and the key-macro
configuration: they are stored in their own Config
file and have therefore no special function for
saving.

@
10615
You can link any .COM .EXE or .BAT file into Cross-
Point, to be started and perform some function.
CrossPoint must be able to find this program, either
in the CrossPoint directory, or in the DOS Path (see
your DOS manual for "Path" info).

A special feature here is the currently selected
Message can be passed to this called program,
enabling you to pass packed files to archive viewers,
executable files to virus scanners, messages to
printer programs and so on.

It is even possible to call up certain CrossPoint
internal functions with the function keys, for
example for Netcalls (*NETCALL-Option) and
reorganisation (*REORG)

Details are to be found in the individual entry
fields when editing an entry (press "E" to edit..)

@
10701
<<Re-Org / Messages

Deletes all messages which are scheduled for
deletion, either by being marked by you or because
they have reached the set time limit. The time is
measured from the <<"date received">>.

Note that extra disk space is needed during the
reorganisation. As a general rule; about one tenth of
the space used by CrossPoint in total. The more the
better.

The reorganisation can take a long time on a large
data base, but can be interrupted with <Esc>.
@
10702
<<Re-Org / Pack

During the message reorganisation, "holes" are left
in the index database; about 200 Bytes per message.
These holes are gradually reused by new messages, but
in the event of a major clean-up deleting a lot of
messages, a lot of wasted space could exist for a
while. "Pack" eliminated this wasted space all at
once.

Packing is even slower than the message Re-Org, but
that should not be a problem, since it is seldom
needed.
@
10703
<<Re-Org / Newsgroups

Deletes newsgroups which have not got any messages in
them. You can choose whether to delete all empty
newsgroups, or confirm the deletion of each one in
turn.

@
10704
<<Re-Org / Users

Deletes Users who:

þ have no messages in their Archive newsgroups,

þ are not included in the address book and

þ who do not have an active message filter.
@
10705
<<Re-Org / Address Book

Removes Users with no messages in their archive
newsgroups from the address book. They remain in the
User list.

@
10706
<<Re-Org / DupeKill

All dupes (duplicate messages) are set to delete.

Dupes can only be recognised as having the same
message ID and the same send date (i.e. the text
cannot be evaluated). Normally these should not occur
anyway, but due to errors in net transport they do
occur (or if you read in your netcall puffer more
than once by mistake).

Messages set to "hold" are excluded from the dupe
check.

The log file <<DUPES.LOG>> logs all found dupes.

<<Re-Org / Change Server

This will re-allocate all newsgroups and or users
from one Server to another.

<<This can be important>> because CrossPoint notes
from which Server messages from Users and Newsgroups
have come, so as to send any reply out through the
correct Server. Replying to messages received from
an old Server produces an error message because the
reply wants to use a Server that may not exist any
more.

<<Config / Display / Colours

The display colours are a matter of taste. You can
set the colours for practically every aspect of
CrossPoint to your own taste.
@
10902
<<Config / Display / Newsgroups

Options for the display for newsgroups and users.
@
10903
<<Config / Display / Messages

Settings for the display of messages in newsgroups.
For example you can switch the display of the message
date or the sender box on or off.
@
10904
<<Config / Display / Header

Sets how the message header in the lister and when
"extracting with header" should look.

This menu item replaces the corresponding individual
settings in /Config/External/Lister in older versions
of CrossPoint.
@
10905
<<Config / Display / Lines

CrossPoint exploits the capabilities of EGA and VGA
graphics and offers various settings for the number
of screen lines displayed. Changed settings become
effective immediately.

If you have set your own font with the /f: parameter,
this setting has no effect.
@
10906
<<Config / Display / Misc..

The various display options are valid at present only
for the screen saver at the current time. A delay
between 5 and 10000 seconds can be set or it can be
switched off by entering 0.

The screen saver can be switched on <<directly>> by
pressing <Alt 1>.
@
11001
<<XPoint / Import / Z-Netz Puffer

This imports a Z-Netz (Zerberus(r) compatible) packet
in either Netcall or Z-Connect format. This is useful
in the event that a message puffer needs to be
read-in without making a netcall; perhaps after
repairing a message puffer, it could not be read-in
during the netcall or perhaps a message puffer from
somewhere else needs to be read-in.

During the import, any new newsgroups or new users
for the user list are shown highlighted as usual.
@
11002
<<XPoint / Import / other format

Imports message packets in FIDO (.pkt), MagicNET,
QuickMail, QWK or MausTausch (INFILE) format.

CrossPoint automatically uses the correct converter
(MAGGI, ZFIDO or QWK) to convert the packet to
Z-Netz format and import it.

You must have a server defined (/Edit/Servers) for
the type whose packet format is the same as that of
the packet to be imported.

A newsgroup list for the box in question should exist
to enable a MagicNET packet to be imported correctly.

@
11003
<<XPoint / Import / User List

Here, you can read-in a list of addresses from a
text file and import them into the User database.

@
11004
<<XPoint / Import / Newsgroup list (Z-Netz)

Normally, a new newsgroup is listed automatically.
If you want to have all newsgroups to which you can
subscribe listed, you can read in a list of them
here (you can get this list from your news server)
and CrossPoint enters all the listed Newsgroups in
the list. The main Server, as configured under
/Edit/Servers, will be used as the Server for these
new newsgroups.

Note! This function is not designed to give you a
newsgroup list from which you can select to subscribe
to. For that, you use /Message/News manager/read file.

@
11005
<<XPoint / Import / MauTau
If you have used the MausTausch program "MauTau" up
to now, you can use this function to import the
MauTau message base into CrossPoint.

This Program is based on "MT2OUTF" from Peter
Redecker \@ DO.
@
11006
<<XPoint / Import / Yuppie

If you have used the Fido Point program "Yuppie" up
to now, you can use this function to import the
Yuppie message base into CrossPoint.

<<Message / Extract / Message

This extracts the currently selected message to a
file. You can define in what form the message is to
be extracted under [/Message/Extract/As...].@11205

You can use this function for both text and binary
messages.
@
11202
<<Message / Extract / UUdecode

In some nets binary messages are transferred using
UUcode (Unix-to-Unix-Coding). They look like this:


begin 644 datei.ext
M1TE&.#=A\@ +@ 9       /___RP     @ +@ 0 "^XR/J<OM#Z.
M^P^&XDB6YHFFZLJV[\@O'\DS7]HWG^L[W_@\,"H?$HO&(3"J7S*
M]8K-:K?<KO<+#HO'Y++YC$ZKU^RV^PV/R^?TNOV.S^OW_+[_#Q\@

You can convert these messages back into their proper
form using the built in UUdecoder in CrossPoint. Any
extra text at the beginning or the end is ignored.
You can decode more than one marked message, to
reassemble a split file.

@
11203
<<Message / Extract / Newsgroup

Extracts all messages on the current display
to a file.

This actually operates on messages <<on display>>. Since
you can also display messages in newsgroup form by
marking them (e.g. after a search, or "Outgoing"
messages) or subject to your ["View"] conditions,@50
you have many possibilities for extracting messages.
@
11204
<<Message / Extract / Reference tree

Extracts all messages belonging to the displayed
reference tree to a file.

The reference tree for a FIDO, Maus or ZConnect
message is activated by pressing "\#".
@
11205
<<Message / Extract / Marked

All marked messages are extracted to a file. The
messages can come from different newsgroups. remember
that all marked messages remain marked until
specifically unmarked with <Ctrl-E>, or by using the
menu [/Message/Search/Unmark], or until you exit@10507
CrossPoint.
@
11206
<<Message / Extract / As..

CrossPoint can extract messages in one of 4 forms:

  o  as Text without header, ie. purely the message
     text.

  o  as Text with header - in the form as it appears
     in the message lister.

  o  as Puffer - in the form of a message packet, as
     it would be transferred over the net.
     In this form it can be imported with
     /XPoint/Import/Puffer.

  o  as Quote - with your quote sign in front of each
     line using the template as when replying to
     public messages.

Binary files may only be extracted as "Text without
header" or in puffer form. Even if other settings are
set, only the message contents (w/o header) will be
extracted.

@
11207
<<Message / Extract / MIME-Decode

This allows you to extract and decode a MIME
multipart message.

Cursor over "File" in the "Message-Part" box,
press <Enter> and either accept the filename
or type in a new filename.

<<Messages / All / Hold

This operates on all messages <<being displayed>>, i.e.
subject to your ["View"] conditions, or even marked@50
messages, eg. ones just located by a search.
Puts the messages to "permanent hold" (see  also
[message reading window]) so that they won't be removed@30
by [Re-Org] when the normal time expires.@10701

@
11402
<<Message / All / Delete

This operates on all messages <<being displayed>>, i.e.
subject to your ["View"] conditions, or even marked@50
messages, eg. ones just located by a search.
Puts the messages to "delete" (see  also
[message reading window]) so that they will be@30
removed by the next [Re-Org].@10701

However, if the list to be deleted should contain
messages on ["Hold"] (see  also [message window])@30
CrossPoint will ask if you are sure you want to
delete them.
@
11403
<<Messages / All / marked

This operates on all messages <<being displayed>>, i.e.
subject to your ["View"] conditions.@50
Sets them all to "marked".
@
11404
<<Messages / All / normal

This operates on all messages <<being displayed>>, i.e.
subject to your ["View"] conditions.@50
Sets them all to unmarked and not on hold or delete.
@
11405
<<Message / All / Read

This operates on all messages <<being displayed>>, i.e.
subject to your ["View"] conditions.@50
Sets them all as having been read.
@
11406
<<Message / All / Kill

This operates on all messages <<being displayed>>, i.e.
subject to your ["View"] conditions.@50
It actually removes them from the message base, as
opposed to setting them to delete for the next [Re-Org].@10701

Messages in the display on hold or "outgoing" (shown
by a "!") are not "killed".
@
11407
<<Message / All / Print

This operates on all messages <<being displayed>>, i.e.
subject to your ["View"] conditions.@50
Messages are printed. The printer settings under
/Config/Printer are used.
@
11501
<<Netcall / Single

Makes a <<Netcall>> to one of your Servers. A list of
those you have defined (under /Edit/Servers) is
displayed so that you can pick the one to call.
Select the Server you wish to call and press <Enter>.

Note: does not enable an on-line Login.

If it doesn't work, make sure all the details
required for a Point netcall are properly entered
under /Edit/Servers/..., and that all supplementary
programs (packers, transfer protocol etc.) are
properly defined and that CrossPoint can find them.
@
11502
<<Netcall / All

This makes a netcall to all of the servers for which
under /Edit/Servers/Edit/Misc. the box marked
Netcall All is switched on.

A command line showing all the boxes to be called
will be shown, and can be edited if you don't want to
call them all.

The [command line parameter] "/n:*" does the@4020
same thing.
@
11503
<<Netcall / Time

Enables a timer for making a single netcall at a
specified time of day, once.

set the desired time in the time box, and the
required box (<F2> selects from a list of your
servers)
@
11504
<<Netcall / Relogin

Makes a netcall to a server when the telephone
connection per modem already exists (if the server is
ready for it). If your server permits the relogin
command, it will do a logoff, but does not hang up
and presents the mask again for a login.
Exit your terminal program <<(do not hang up)>> and
start CrossPoint then Netcall/Relogin. CrossPoint
does not reset the modem or dial, but begins by
sending the correct entry for Login and carries
on from there if the right responses come from the
box.

FIDO does nor permit Relogin for technical reasons.

@
11505
<<Netcall / Online  (CrossTerm)

A simple terminal program. It is not meant as a full
fledged terminal program, but rather for a quick
on-line call for a look or some simple task (or maybe
testing the modem).

Enter dialling commands by hand ("ATDP5554321 etc.")

If you have a password (your on-line password of
course) entered under /Edit/Servers/Edit/Misc, it
will do  a Login for you (not FIDO, UUCP or GS-Box).

A simple on-line help is available with <F1>.

Exit with <Alt-X>.

Note: "Exit without hanging up" may not work.

@
11506
<<Netcall / Automatic

Activates one of the programmed timing lists which
you can set up under [/Netcall/Timing list].@11507

You are asked to enter the number of the timing list
you wish to activate. CrossPoint then runs this
program until you end it (with <Esc> or the special
case, that one of the commands to be carried out ends
the timing program.
@
11507
<<Netcall / Timing List

You can set up to 99 [timing programs], which allow@4022
CrossPoint to carry out various relevant tasks,
programmed to time of day, day of the week or month,
etc.

Enter the number of the program you wish to edit,
then one of the commands on the bottom line.
Toggle a line in the list active or not with "A"
(Active) (indicated by a "+"). Inactive lines will
not be executed when the timing list runs.

When starting for the first time, press "N" (New) and
use the on-line help under each entry.

Once set up, these programs can be used under the
menu entry [/Netcall/Automatic].@11506
@
11601
<<Edit / Templates

Under this entry, the various message templates can
be written and edited. These templates form the basis
of messages, by entering a certain framework of text
of your choice which is always the same for each
message, like the date, your introductory text, your
signature at the end and so on. There are some
default templates, but you can write as many as you
wish and allocate them to different types of message,
based on newsgroup groups.

Variables like the date, the name of the person being
replied to and so on can be entered by using [macros]@11650
which are replaced with the appropriate entry by
CrossPoint for each message.

Note that signatures <<cannot>> contain macros (there is
no real necessity) and if they do, the whole macro
will be ignored.
@
11602
<<Edit / Servers

This is the menu for configuring all aspects of a
Server and Point. You may have as many Servers as
you like.
@
11603
<<Edit / Groups

Each newsgroup is allocated to one, and one only,
group. You can have individual settings for each of
these groups, like message size limits, message
headers and signatures. There are certain default
groups, but you can add as many others as you wish.
@
11604
<<Edit / Systems
This menu entry serves to hold various attributes and
functions for systems (boxes). At present the
following details can be recorded:
* Z-Netz fileservers which work with SendMsg,
* UUCP fileservers (see UUCP.DOC),
* The entries for crash passwords for FIDO
  systems.

Note that not everyone has automatic access to a
Z-Netz fileserver, it has to be agreed with your
system administrator.

@
11605
<<Edit / Short names

You can allocate short names to as many newsgroups or
users as you wish. This saves a lot of typing if you
often have to enter these names, as when sending
messages direct or forwarding them.
@
11606
<<Edit / Auto Send

Under this menu entry you can administer <<files>>, which
will be automatically sent as <<messages>> at programmed
intervals, or once at a set time. You can have as
many as you wish.
@
11607
<<Edit / Text

This menu first asks you to enter a file name or
type, and then gives you a point and shoot selection
of those types of files, then presents the selected
one in the editor for editing.

You can select your way through directories also, if
no directory is specified at the beginning, the one
specified under [/Config/Paths/Send directory] will@262
be presented by default.

See also:  [Internal Editor]@54
@

                evaluated the same as $TUSER
  $VPSEUDO   -  the same as $PSEUDO, but $VORNAME
                (first name) will be used instead of
                $TUSER.

<<XPoint / Statistics / Memory

Information about the usage of main, EMS and hard
disk memory.

In the hard disk section, the size of all CrossPoint
files in all its directories together is given.

The available main memory is the amount of memory
currently free plus the amount CrossPoint could swap
out. It is the amount CrossPoint could make available
to start an external program.

@
11702
<<XPoint / Statistics / Messagebase

This statistic shows how many messages would be
deleted if a Re-Org [(/Re-Org/Messages)] were to be@10701
carried out, and how much disk space this would free
up.
@
11703
<<XPoint / Statistics / Database

Displays the number of data sets and the usage of the
individual CrossPoint data base files.


   MSGS         Message Files
   BRETTER      Newsgroup list
   USER         User list
   BOXEN        Servers ([/Edit/Servers])@11602
   GRUPPEN      Newsgroup groups ([/Edit/Groups])@11603
   SYSTEME      Fileserver etc. ([/Edit/Systems])@11604
   AUTOMSG      Autosend Msgs. ([/Edit/Autosend])@11606
   PSEUDOS      Short names ([/Edit/short names\])@11605
   BEZUEGE      Reference links

The usage shows how much of the reserved disk space
is actually being used. If this usage seems to remain
low (< 70% approx.), it may be time to do a pack with
[/Re-Org/Pack]. Note that this will take a long time
for a large message base, but may release a large
amount of disk space. The usage will be 100%
afterwards.

A <<COPY>> of the current message is forwarded to
either a User, a Newsgroup or sent "Direct". You can
select the recipient from either a list of
Newsgroups, a list of Users or choose to send the
message "Direct". The [Template/Forward] is used@10807
to indicate that the message has been copied. You

come to you and the original sender is noted in the
message header.

NOTE: Neither a signature nor an origin are appended
      to the end of the copied message!
@
12102
<<Message / Forward / Original

(ZConnect, UseNet and Maus only)
Forwards the original message to a user or newsgroup.
You can select the recipient from the lists. The
original sender is not changed, so replies go to
him/her (but you are noted as forwarder in the
header). The [template "forward"] is used.@10807
@
12103
<<Message / Forward / Comment

A copy of the current message is forwarded to a
User or Newsgroup. You can select from a list.

The text is presented to you in the editor so that
you may add your own comments before forwarding the
message.
NOTE: A template is NOT used!
@
12104
<<Message / Forward / Quote

A copy of the current message is forwarded to a
User or Newsgroup. You can select from a list.

The ["Quote to" template] is used and the text is@10806

þ Newsgroup name
@
12107
<<Message / Forward / Cancel

<<RFC/UUCP:>>  Sends out a cancel message for the
selected newsgroup message, as long as it was written
by you. In this way a message already sent out can be
deleted. The cancel message takes the same route as
the original, and everywhere they meet, the original
is deleted. (It does not prevent the original being
seen, before the cancel message arrives).

See also [/Config/Opt./Nets/Cancel-Messages].@798

<<MausNet:>>   This only cancels an already sent
message, if it has not gone from the server into the
net.

@
12108
<<Message / Forward / Repost

The selected message will be resent (reposted) to the
recipient. If you have defined a ["Repost" template],@10808

a particular message, you can change the date.

The receipt date is shown in the message window.
@
12203
<<Message / Change / Rot13

Rot13 coded messages cannot automatically be
recognised. This enables the state of a message to be
switched between "Rot13" or "not".

<<Fido / Nodelists / Config

Activates a chosen [Nodelist]. CrossPoint will offer@4024
you the choice from any nodelists in the form
NODELIST.xxx which you may have on your disk.
Once selected, CrossPoint copies the list into the
subdirectory FIDO and indexes it for use.

At least once at the beginning you will have to
activate a complete NodeList in this way. After that
the [NODEDIFF] system (see FIDO.DOC, "NodeList")@4024
should keep your list up to date.
@
13002
<<Fido / Nodelists / Update

Will read a [Nodediff] (which you can select) and@4024
update your [nodelist], as long as the nodediff is@4024
exactly 7 days older than the NodeList. Only
the next nodediff in line can update a NodeList.

[Nodediffs] must be unpacked first when handled like@4024
this.

See also FIDO.DOC, "NodeList".
@
13003
<<Fido / Nodelists / Shrink

The [NodeList] is very large. If you will not need to@4024
communicate with some of the FIDO world areas, you
can cut them out of your NodeList, and save
considerable space.

Tell CrossPoint which zones and regions you wish to
have.

The zone numbers in FIDO are:

  <<1>>  North America      <<4>>  South America
  <<2>>  Europe             <<5>>  Africa
  <<3>>  Oceania            <<6>>  Asia

Some statistics from your node list.
@
13008
<<Fido / Nodelists / Find

You can browse the data for Fido nodes. Enter the
node address in the usual form <Zone>:<Net>/<Node>.
If you leave off the zone and even the net,
CrossPoint will take the zone and net of your main
Fido server (Bossnode) as default.

Instead of an address you can enter the name of a
sysop or point. Enter the surname, first part of the
surname or the full name.
@
13101
<<Fido / Request

A Fido "Request" is more commonly referred to as a
"File Request" or "F'req" for short. Most Fido
systems (but not all) will accept File Requests
from anyone. To make File Requests you will need:

- An active NodeList.
- A main Fido Server entered under /Edit/Servers.

You can enter the Node address direct if you want.
CrossPoint checks to see if it is in the NodeList.
If it is, you may then enter the name(s) of the
file(s) you wish to request or, you can press <F2>
and browse the filelists that you have configured.

By checking the tick box (with <Space>) you can have
the request start immediately, or let it be stored
for later, maybe under a timing program.

Stored requests are to be found under
[/Fido/Crash] and can be started from there.@13104
@
13102
<<Fido / File lists

Fido sytems offer lists of files they have available
for request and are obtainable from most systems by
requesting "FILES". You may request such lists and
then use them for selecting files to request. These
functions are for handling these lists.
@
13103
<<Fido / File Areas

Many Fido boxes offer areas (newsgroups) where files
instead of messages are exchanged. Subscribing to
these areas is not done with the normal area manager
but a special "file manager". But it works the same
way.

Under this menu you will find all the functions
necessary for administering these file areas.
It is analog to the menu /Message/News manager

The file manager must be configured first under
/Edit/Servers/Edit/Fido, before it will function.

@
13104
<<Fido / Crash

This menu initiates sending Crash Mails (the box
where the recipient is rung up directly and the
message "delivered") and Request mails that have
already been set up under [/Fido/Request].@13101

You need for this:

- An activated NodeList.
- A main Fido server entered under /Edit/Servers.
 (You need this because the  system demands
 that you are in Fido and have a Fido "base")

You make a crash mail by pressing "R" when you in the
send window after writing a message.

You have CrossPoint deal with Crashes through
a [timer list].@4022

<<Fido / Filelists / Import

When you have received a Fido file-list in the
correct format, you can read it in here. You get a
chance to select the file you want to read in,
CrossPoint tries to recognise from the file name
which Fido box it is for, but you may have to tell
CrossPoint explicitly, and it then copies it into the
FIDO subdirectory under a new name, and makes a note
of its existence in FILELIST.CFG, then asks if you
want to delete the original list.

Packed lists are unpacked automatically, provided the
necessary unpacker is set up
(Config/External/unpacker)
@
13202
<<Fido / Filelists / Delete

Deletes the selected file list. The entry is also
deleted from FILELIST.CFG
@
13203
<<Fido / Filelists / Search

This is for browsing through your file lists
searching for the file you want. Enter the search
string and CrossPoint looks through *all* lists and
gathers all the occurrences together in a list.

If you want to search for more as one item then
divide the items with - /& -.
For example:
	/&terminal/&modem/&hello
will find all files whose description includes
the words "terminal" AND "modem" AND "hello".

Marking the files you want to order from this list
with <Space>, press <Enter> to start setting up the
request.

not need this.
@
13302
<<Re-Org / Misc.. / Read MsgIDs

After an update from before Ver 1.93 to after
1.93, this function should be run once. It adapts the
message data base to the new improved reference
linking.
@
13303
<<Re-Org / Misc.. / Test Messagebase

Tests the complete message base for errors. Any
messages detected as defective are set to "delete"
and marked (in case you want to check them). They
will be deleted at the next Re-Org. Possibly damaged
storage files (MPUFFER.*) are also corrected.

Note: If a large number of messages are damaged,
maybe through a disk crash, is better to correct
the storage files and re-read them in.

@
13304
<<Re-Org / Misc.. / Read Dates

CrossPoint notes the date of the newest message in
each newsgroup, and whether unread messages are
present. Normally this data is kept up to date
automatically. This function forces an update.

If you eliminate all the messages in a newsgroup with
"K" the newsgroup will remain marked as containing
unread messages until the next netcall. Forcing an
update will correct this, if it disturbs you.
@
13305
<<Re-Org / Misc / Newsgroup index

The newsgroups index (not to be confused with the
newsgroup database index file BRETTER.IX1) determines
the order in which the newsgroups are displayed. This

The newsgroup order can be changed with "move" in the
special mode of the newsgroup window.

<<Fido / Pointlist / Activate

The point list is very similar to the way [node lists]@4024
are handled, except they are for points...

Activates a point list, which must have the file name
as entered under /Fido/Options (and a 3 figure number
as extension). The list must have either the
4D-format or the POINTS24 list format. Check that you
have the right format installed.

CrossPoint copies the point list into the FIDO sub-
directory.

At least once at the start you will need a complete
list, after that the pointdiffs should keep the file
up to date.

@
13402
<<Fido / Pointlist / Read Diff

The pointdiff PR24DIFF is distributed each week. To
read them in, unpack them first with ARC, then select
the resultant file through this function.
@
13501
<<Message / Database / Search

Query a data bank by various criteria. After saving
the search query, you have to make a net call to send
the query to the data bank. A second netcall is
necessary to collect the result.

If the error message "no databases found" occurs, you
have forgotten to get a list of the available
databases with [/Message/Database/List]@13504
@
13502
<<Message / Database / Request

As opposed to the query, which delivers a list of
data sets meeting the search criteria, this function
allows the requesting of a particular data set in a
data bank, like a program from a program library, or
a picture from a picture data bank.

To use this a list of the data bank contents must
have been obtained with [Message/Data bank/Contents].@13505

@
13504
<<Message / Database / List

A list of all available databases is requested from a
specified box. All databases in the list are then
available for querying with [Message/Database/Search].@13501
@
13505
<<Message / Database / Contents

For requesting the contents summary of a database.
This is not always possible, it depends on the
structure of the database concerned. For very large
databases even a contents summary would be too big to
transfer. In such cases the query function should be
used.
@
13506
<<Message / Database / Info

A special short info-text for a particular box is
requested. This can contain general information or
special operating instructions for the databases on
offer.
@
13601
<<XPoint / Export / Userlist

The list of all recorded users is exported to a file.
@
13602
<<XPoint / Export / Newsgroup List

A list of all the newsgroups in CrossPoint is
exported to a file.
@
13603
<<XPoint / Export / Message List

Writes a list of all currently displayed messages to
a file.
The position, size, date of writing, type, sender and
subject are recorded.

@
13604
<<XPoint / Export / Screenshot

The contents of the screen are captured to a file.
@

<<Config / Options / Nets / Miscellaneous

Various options which are respectively valid only for
a particular net type are gathered together here.

The Fido options are under /Fido/Options.
@
13702
<<Config / Options / Nets / PM-Limits

You can set a maximum limit for PMs, above which
CrossPoint will warn you about the size when you send
it.
@
13801
<<Fido / File Areas / Subscribe

Works similarly to [/Message/News Manager/Subscribe]@11901
but for File Areas (where files instead of messages
are exchanged). You order the file areas you wish to
subscribe to.
@
13802
<<Fido / File Areas / Unsubscribe

Works similarly to [/Message/News Manager/Unsubscribe]@11902
but for File Areas (where files instead of messages
are exchanged). You cancel the file areas you no
longer wish to subscribe to.

Note: CrossPoint does not check that marked areas
from the area list really are file areas and not
message areas, nor does it check that the file
manager for the particular box is correctly
configured. Check this yourself.
@
13803
<<Fido / File Areas / Get List

Requests a current file area list. When received it
is activated with [Import list].@13804

The file manager under /Edit/Servers/Edit/Fido must
be configured correctly.
@
13804
<<Fido / File Areas / Import list
The currently selected message will be read in as a
file area list. It should therefore be one.

After being imported, the list can be used for
subscribing to individual file areas.
@
13805
<<Fido / File Areas / Others

Various other file manager commands.
<<LIST>>, <<QUERY>>, and <<UNLINKED>> request various
forms of file list
<<PAUSE>> and <<RESUME>> are used for temporarily
stopping all subscribed file areas; useful for
example if you go on holiday.

<<PWD>> changes the Filemanager-Pass word. Wait for
the confirmation of the change before you change the
pass word entry under /Edit/Servers/Edit/Fido and
send off more requests.
PWD does <<not>> work with the filemanager <<AllFix>>,
which has a different command.

<<INFO>> and <<STATUS>> both do the same thing, some
use one, some the other (see HELP).

<<HELP>> Requests a help text, which should tell you
among other things, whether INFO or STATUS the one to
use is.

<<NOTIFY ON>> and <<NOTIFY OFF>> are only supported
by very few file mangers.

CrossPoint was not able to delete a file. Either the
file is not there (perhaps already been deleted some

The MPUFFER files make up the message base in
CrossPoint. All messages in there are therefore
already in CrossPoint, and it does not seem sensible
to read them in again.

If you wish to re-import the puffer files, perhaps
because the Message base is defective, follow
carefully the instructions in XPOINT.DOC in the
chapter under repairing data loss.
@

This net does not support [reference links].@4014
@
20409
The selected message has no [reference links].@4014
Possible reasons are:

þ  This net does not support reference links anyway.

þ  It is a new message to which no-one has replied
   and therefore there are no links.

þ  The links have been broken, either by somebody
   along the line using a program that does not
   support reference links, or because of a missing
   message.

There is so valid recipient entered for the selected
AutoSend message. Check the settings with "Edit".

Somebody has deleted one of the message base
(MPUFFER.xxx) files. All references to messages in
this file will be deleted.

CrossPoint then carries out a Re-Org.

If you deliberately deleted the file, ignore the
message and carry on. Otherwise you can try to find
the missing file (renamed, undelete, backup, there is
hope yet..) and <<re-import>> its messages (don't just
rename it to MPUFFER!) with /XPoint/Import/Puffer.

You cannot edit the text in messages labelled binary.
You can change the binary type to "text" with
/Message/Change/Type.
@
20424
There is an inconsistency in the message base.
This is usually due to some error when the hard disk
was being written to. For example:

þ A program crash during a Re-Org or netcall.

þ Misuse of a software cache, maybe switching off
  before the buffers were flushed with lazy-write on.
  (A well known error with Smartdrive)

See XPOINT.DOC for advice about how to proceed if the
message base becomes damaged.

Note: The message base files (MPUFFER.xxx) themselves
may not be damaged (XPCHECK or ZPR shows no damage),
nevertheless there is an inconsistency with other
files, which must be corrected.

@
20426

There is an inconsistency between the outgoing
message packets (*.pp files) and the message base.

The error should disappear at latest after a netcall
has been made to every server.

If not, make sure that there are no messages waiting
to be sent, then delete all the files *.pp.

@
20427
One of the outgoing message files (*.pp) has become
damaged. You can try to repair it with ZAP or ZPR as
appropriate (read the advice in the instructions for
ZAP & ZPR!). If this does not work you must delete
the *.pp file affected, find messages that were
outgoing (they are still in CrossPoint but no longer
as "Outgoing") and repost them.
@
20428
The selected file which you are trying to extract
exists already in the CrossPoint directory.

To avoid overwriting important files, CrossPoint will

the CrossPoint directory as  the directory for
temporary files needed for unpacking.

It was not possible to unpack the selected file.
Possible reasons:

þ  The unpacker under /Config/Extern/Unpacker
   for the format concerned cannot be found or is
   configured wrong.

þ  There is not enough free hard disk space for the
   operation.


þ  The archive (packed file) is defective.

You can unpacking the file "by hand' under DOS.
If it is a binary type message, extract it first to a
file (/Message/Extract).

Sending zero length messages is not possible with
CrossPoint in this net. Try sending the message again
with one empty line of "text", if you want to send an
"empty" message.

Encoding the message under pmCrypt did not work.
Check that the settings are correct under
/Config/External/pmCrypt, and that the required
cipher program can be found either in the CrossPoint
directory or in the DOS path.

If you still have difficulty, you could try encoding
the text by "Hand" under DOS, to try and narrow down
the error.

The recipient for this message is a user in one of
the boxes that you have entered as a server (under

change under /Re-Org/Misc./Change Server.
@
20620
The message is larger than the limit you have set up
for binary messages under /Config/Options/Messages,

   ZCONNECT and FIDO netcalls, it is NOT sufficient
   for the packer to lie in the CrossPoint directory.

using an OLD version of CrossPoint with Config files
for a newer version. Or the file may have become
damaged.

editing under Edit/Server. It is enough to call up
any one item, eg. Edit/Point, and to re-save it with
<Ctrl-Enter> <<without changing anything>>. The

entries.

It is however best to check, that <<all>> entries are
still correct and have not somehow become changed.

<<PM>>

A "PM" is a private mail, sometimes called net mail.
As opposed to a message written to a public newsgroup
for everyone to read, it goes only to one (or more)
recipients selected by you.

If you write a PM reply to a message in a newsgroup
XP sends that reply automatically only to the person
who wrote the message.

When replying to a PM, of course, you can only write
a PM. (P or Ctrl-P or shift-P).

Trying to write with Ctrl-R or R will give an error
message.

PMs written to a person are stored in Newsgroups
in the [User Overview] (TAB from the normal@21
Newsgroup overview). Press <Enter> on the User
Name, and you will see messages, if present.

<<  Newsgroup (NG)

A Newsgroup is simply one of a large collection of
"places" where messages are written publicly, for
anyone to read, on a specific subject specified
by the title of the Newsgroup.

In FidoNet, Newsgroups are known as Echomail Areas.

The NGs are listed in the Newsgroup overview
window in CrossPoint, showing their titles, which
is a good indicator as to what subject they cover.

To get Newsgroups, you have to [subscribe]@10308
(menu /message/Newsmanager) to them, that is, order
them from whatever source you intend to get your
NGs from.

<<Sending complete Files>>

Instead of writing your text into the editor
directly, you may want to send a file which is
already on your disk.

You can send Text Files, which the reader can
read just as if it were a message, or you can
send Binary Files (Program Files for example)
which are treated in a different way, to prevent
them being corrupted.

You must send binary files as binary.

XP will ask you for a path and name to the file you
want to send. Give it, and XP will either copy into
your SEND directory, or, depending on the
[Binary Limit] set in /Config/Options/Messages@240
just note the path to it for later.

When the next netcall is made, XP will send the file
just like any other message.

<<Direct Mail>> is sent by your server box directly, by
calling the recipient server box directly, but not
necessarily immediately. It will probably be done
during the night at cheap telephone rates.

<<Express Mail>> is sent immediately. Your server box, as
soon as it receives the message from you, rings up
the recipient box as soon as possible to deposit the
message. This will probably be more expensive.

Beware! Both methods cost money, and depending on
your server, they may not be cheap. Usually a
fixed fee plus a charge per kilobyte.

<<Transfer Protocol

<< You need a Transfer Program in addition to XP!

A Transfer Protocol is a kind of code system by which
data are transferred across a modem link. For the
link to work, both sides have to understand this
protocol.
Examples of protocols are Z-Modem, X-Modem, BiModem,
but there are many others.

These protocols are not to be confused with the
programs which can carry them out. There are for
example many programs which can "do" Z-Modem, and
as long as each side has one of these (not
necessarily the same one), the link works.

Many terminal programs have "built in protocols"
and you don't notice when they are being called.

CrossPoint does not have it's own protocol (except
in FIDO, which is special), but calls a separate
program (<<which you must of course have>>, in addition
to CrossPoint) to do the work. This is more flexible.

When CrossPoint has caused the modem to call the
server, it makes a Log On using the data (passwords)
and so on which you entered, and tells the server
which Point is calling, so the server knows to ready
the packet in your point (pigeonhole) to send, and to
receive a (possibly empty) packet from you.

When this point is reached, the server hands over to
a <<transfer program>>, telling it to *receive* a
file. This program readies itself. At the same time
(because it's an agreed system), CrossPoint knows it
has to send a file, your mail packet. Even if you
have no mail to send, it sends a dummy packet.
CrossPoint also calls up an external program, and
this indicates to the other side that it wants to
send. They understand each other, because they
"speak" the same protocol, the transfer is made and
ended.
The same (or other, if you really want) programs are
immediately called again, this time for the server
to send and your side to receive.

If they don't understand each other for any reason
(wrong program, wrong parameters), an error occurs
and they break off.

This is why you must agree with your sysop beforehand
which protocol is to be used.

Make sure the program you are going to use is in a
path (PATH: see DOS handbook) where XP can find it.
XP even beeps to warn you if, when you exit the
dialog box, it cannot "see" the program you entered.

In the server set-up, you have to enter the correct
parameters for whatever program you are using
(XP pre enters them for the most common ones, if
you use something exotic, see its handbook), once for
the upload where you *send*, and once for the
download, where you *receive*.

@
4006
<<Packers

Packers are programs external to CrossPoint, which
compress the data before transfer, or decompress it
after transfer (the server does the same).

This compression really reduces the quantity of
data to be transferred, and saves a lot of time
and money.

The packer is called in a similar way to the
[transfer program], but before the transfer.@4005

<< You need a packer>>, and so that both sides can
unpack what the other side packed, it needs to be
agreed beforehand between you and your sysop, which
packer will be used.

There are others that you can learn about with
experience, but the only ones worth bothering
about at the start are:
ARJ
LHA
PKZIP and its unpacker PKUNZIP

ARJ is *free* for private use, packs well, is fast
and well known these days for DOS. It is not used
on other [platforms] (Amiga etc.), but agree it with@4007
your sysop if you can.

LHA is also free, is good but not quite so fast and
does not pack quite so well as ARJ. It is very well
known and used on all platforms.

PKZIP/PKUNZIP are very good, also available for all
[platforms] but for DOS it is shareware and you@4007
should pay for it (other platforms have it free).

These programs are known to XP, and as long as
XP can find them (in the current directory,
DOS PATH (see DOS handbook), or give the enter
the full path name), all parameters are entered
for you. XP even beeps to warn you if, when you
exit the dialog box, it cannot "see" the packer.

The packer has to be called, telling it what file
to pack and what to name the result, or which file
to unpack (the name of the result is already in the
packed file). This is all entered automatically for
the packers known to CrossPoint.

@
4007
<<Platform

Basically the type of Operating System, as MS-DOS
is to the PC. OS/2 is another "platform", as is
Unix (Unix on different types of computer is only
one platform!), Amigas or Ataris with their operating
systems are different platforms, etc.

The subject becomes important in Data Exchange,
because your Modem can get a connect and exchange
data with a a modem on a completely different type
of machine.

Text Files are the same all over, but just because
you can pack with ARJ, doesn't mean that ARJ is
available to him to unpack. There may be no ARJ for
a Cray supercomputer, no matter how fast it is.

@
4008
Point Password, as agreed with your sysop.
Do not confuse your [Point] password@140
with your normal User Password for on-line calls.
Your Point Password accesses the pigeonhole for
your point in the server.
You can use the same password for both (but it's not
good security).
@
4009
<<AKA & FIDO-compatible Networks,
(AKA =  Also Known As)

There are many Networks which are based on the same
software and technology as FIDO but are separate
from FIDO. These Networks have addresses for their
Points which are similar to, but different from, the
"real" FIDO. Many Fido systems carry these other
Networks in addition to Fido but they are separate
Networks. If you have one or more of these
"alternative" addresses (or Points) in these other
Networks, then, as well as your main Fido address,
you will need to send your "Also Known As" (AKA)
because when you make your Netcall, you want to be
able to get and send the mail packets for these other
Networks at the same time.

If you poll with [EMSI], you can do this. It does not@158
work with YooHoo.

If you list your AKA's in your main Fido Server entry
in CrossPoint, CrossPoint will know that it also has
to collect and send mail packets for these addresses.
The packets are kept separate for the different Nets.

<<Setting up AKAs
First, you simply set up the addresses for these Nets
each under its own Server, (see /Edit/Servers) where
they are all identical to your main Fido Server,
except the Node address is different.

You do <<NOT>> need to call these Servers, they just
serve as the correct gathering point for messages for
these Nets.

CrossPoint can then keep the Areas coming from these
Nets separate and send your replies and messages into
the correct Net. The areas are then automatically
allocated to the correct Net. Just be careful, if you
should add an Area by hand, to make sure you allocate
it to the correct Server for that Net.

Then enter these other addresses in your main Fido
Server in the appropriate boxes "AKA" and "Send
packets for".

Remember, it only works with EMSI and when
CrossPoint makes a Netcall to your main server, it
includes Netcall operations for these AKAs at the
same time.

Example:
Your main Fido address is 2:245/678.15
Your BossNode is 2:245/678 and you are Point 15.

You participate in 2 other Nets on this Server as
9:111/222.15   and
987:1/15 (a small Net where all [Points are Nodes])@8001

Set up 3 identical servers, except with the 3
different addresses, leaving "AKA" and "send packets
for" empty.
For 987:1/15 set the switch "use node address"

In the main server, set under "select" <<main Fido
<<server>> ON.

In this server enter in "AKA"
9:111/222.15 987:1/15 (separated by a <space>)

and "send packets for"
9:111/222 987:1/0
Note that here the point number is left off, and in
the small net "0" is used

@
4010
<< Fido Addresses, Nodes and Points

Points are addresses which are only indirectly on the
net. They can only call up their particular server to
collect their messages, and deliver messages to be
sent on by that server. Mail can only be sent to them
care of their server.

A "true" Fido box is directly on the net, and must be
capable of being called directly by other boxes to
deliver and collect mail. These type of boxes are
called nodes, or hubs, and have addresses of the form
2:555/666. This means in the world area 2, they are
in the  sub area 555, and the node number 666 in that
sub area. Servers are of course this type of box.

Points are just extensions to a node, and have an
extra number on the node number, after a point, as
address, e.g. 2:555/666.24 (24 is the point number).

Points do not have the same rights and capabilities
in Fido as nodes.

In some of the [Fido compatible nets], especially where@4009
the numbers are small, all participants are raised to
the status of nodes, with a node address, even if
other nodes cannot call them direct.

@
4011
<< UARTs, 16550, FIFO

The normal serial port of a PC is equipped with a
serial I/O chip called a UART. Older PC's may be
fitted with a 16450 UART. This version basically gets
the bits, as they come from the modem, makes a byte,
tells the CPU (by means of a so-called interrupt)
that it is there and holds each one for the CPU to
fetch, one at a time. If the CPU, for some reason,
doesn't pick it up in time, it gets over-written by
the next one and data is lost.

Although it's hard to believe, the CPU is so fast
that most of the time, it gets it. But older, slower
computers do have problems at/over 19200bps.

Faster computers, like the 486 and 586 manage better
but not infinitely better and especially so long
as they are not doing anything else, like
multitasking. Under Windows or OS/2 even fast
computers can get into trouble and "drop" bytes.

You observe this as drastically reduced transfer
rates, block re-sends and so on.

Fortunately, there is a simple and fairly cheap
solution: the 16550 FIFO UART.

This has quite simply a 16 byte (yes, just 16 bytes)
buffer. Therefore, the computer only needs to go get
bytes one sixteenth (a bit sooner to be safe) as
often. (FIFO just means First In First Out and is
not relevant to our explanation)

The good part is that this thing is directly pin
compatible to the 16450 one. You pull the old one
out and put the new one in. It costs about $10.

You just need a (normal) serial interface card
(COM Port) where the 16450 chips are in sockets
and can be removed, get one of these 16550 (most
electronics shops have them now that they are in
demand), and plug it in <<the right way round>>.

<<NOTE:>>.There are various versions with similar
numbers, not all quite so good. Get one from
National Semiconductor with 16550AN or 16550AFN
(the N is important here!) on them. Some non-
original versions are not recognised properly by
CrossPoint.

There are of course more exotic versions, special
adapter cards, etc., but research into these is left
to the reader.

@
4012
<<Re:

It is usual in some nets to preface the (original)
subject with "Re:" when replying to a message.

Some people take this to be an abbreviation of
"Reply" or even "reference", but it throws back
to older days of business letter writing, where,
from the Latin, it meant "on the subject of:"
and was the customary form for saying what you were
writing about, in particular for referring to
previous correspondence, hence its use in e-mail.

A new subject is written without "Re:", a reply with.

Not all nets like it though, so be careful. MausNet
does not use it at all, UseNet uses only a simple,
single "Re:". CrossPoint deals with Maus and UseNet
for you, you do not have to set it specially.
Fido is undecided, but it is mostly NOT used.
Z-Netz prefers the "Re^n" form to "Re:Re:Re:".

Many e-mail programs add this "Re:" automatically,
simply sticking it on the front. This can however
lead to long chains of "Re:Re:Re:", and not much room
for the actual subject. Some people think this ugly
and wasteful, and it is common now for programs to
gather up all the "Re:" present, count them, add 1
and produce a summary "Re^n", eg. Re^3, indicating
this is the third level of reply.

CrossPoint offers most possibilities:

a) Gather up the Re:'s to Re^n
b) Just put a Re: on the front, regardless
c) Add no Re:, and even remove any Re: present

There are 2 places this can be set:

1. /Config/Options/Messages for a default setting.
   Here however you can only decide between a) & b)
   above.

2. /Edit/Groups/Edit under "Replies" for the setting
   for that particular group, overriding the default.
   Here you can decide between a), b) & c) above.

@
4013
<<Quote character:

It is usual to mark text that you have quoted from
a previous message with a special character at the
beginning of each line, to show that it's quoted.

This is usually the ">" character. Many programmes
recognise this and can treat quoted text specially,
just as XP can: it can highlight it in a different
colour for clarity and even count the quantity.

Bearing this in mind, in CrossPoint you can use
what you like but remember, you may be quoting text
that is already itself quoted and if it is
complicated, other readers will not be able to follow
who quoted what. Remember that people simply do not
read what they cannot easily follow.

Stick to the ">" character.

@
4014
<<Reference Links>>

A particular subject as it threads its way day by day
with more and more replies through the mass of other
messages builds a so called "thread". Some threads
are small, but some are *very* extensive, with many
branches, and even changes of subject text.

Sometimes it happens that you stumble across a
message that is interesting, but you need to read
the rest of the discussion to understand what is
going on. Otherwise you may write something that
someone else already wrote, or out of context
for example.

Some nets like FIDO and Maus, UseNet and ZCONNECT
(the newer Z-Netz format) link replies to messages
by using and placing information in the header about
which thread the message belongs to.

<<This is called "reference linking" a thread.

In this way messages belonging to the same thread can
be gathered together to be read all at once. (Using
the subject text alone is not unreliable. You will
miss a branch of the thread if the subject changes).

XP asks if you want to keep the link if you change
the subject in a reply to a message.

CrossPoint notes all these "reference links" when a
netcall is imported and has them ready if you want to
see them.

You can see the links, if present, to any message by
pressing "\#". If there are none, it just tells you.

<Alt-B> does a similar function, but the unreliable
way using the subject text, and has to search all
messages every time.

<<AUTOEXEC Directory and Operation

CrossPoint actions files in the AUTOEXEC directory
automatically, at every XP start-up. It also does
this about every 5 minutes (if you are in the main
window and have not pressed a key for 30 seconds).
You can also do this manually by setting a function
key or tool (/Config/Keys or /Config/Tools Menu)
with only "*" for the program and the <<"AutoExec"
switch ON.

CrossPoint actions the file according to the file
extension.

 .ZER  A puffer file in ZCONNECT (Z-Netz) format, it
       is imported, then deleted. The front part of
       the file tells XP which server it comes from,
       eg. HIT.ZER will be imported as coming from
       the server HIT (see EBEST.* below)

 .ZEE  As ZER but sends receipt acknowledgements
       as requested in messages (see EBEST.* below).

 .OUT  A MausTausch-Outfile. It is converted (with
       MAGGI.EXE) to ZCONNECT format, imported and
       deleted. As for ZER, the file name tells XP
       the server name.

 .PKT  Fido-PKT-File. As .OUT converted with
       ZFIDO.EXE. In this case your Fido Boss Node is
       always used as server.

 .MSG  A message file or other file to be sent
       (see below).

 .MSD  As MSG, but is deleted after being sent.

 .IPS  A pre-prepared ZConnect Puffer File. The front
       part of the file name tells XP which server to
       send it to (HIT.IPS sends it to the HIT). (It
       must of course be one of your servers)
       See also parameter /ips below.

 .PAR  A parameter file, with each line a CrossPoint
       [start parameter] which is sent to XP when it@4020
       starts up, just as though it had been entered
       on the command line.
       Is deleted after use.

 .OPT  Just like .PAR, but is NOT deleted.

 .BAT  Any normal batch file. The following special
       batch files have special functions:

        START.BAT  run every time XP is started.
        START1.BAT run at the next start-up of XP,
                   then deleted.
        STOP.BAT   run every time XP is ended.
        STOP1.BAT  run the next time XP is ended then
                   deleted.

All other batch files are <<deleted>> after they have
been run.

 .BAK  The file is simply deleted.

Do not put any other files in the AutoExec directory.

<<Control files for .ZER .OUT & .PKT files

The presence of so-called control files activates
various options for these message-packets as they are
imported. Only the file name is important, not the
contents.
These files have the ending .CTD (deleted after use)
or .CTL (NOT deleted after use)

 EBEST.CTL/.CTD   Sends  receipt confirmations for
                  those messages which have requests
                  for it in them.

 EDATUM.CTL/.CTD  Sets the receipt date of received
                  messages to the date of writing of
                  the message.

 GELESEN.CTL/.CTD Sets the messages straight to
                  "already read".


<<Message Files .MSG/.MSD

    Files to be sent as messages should have the
    following format, to enable the header to be
    produced correctly:

        To:  USER@ADDRESS, /NEWSGROUP or [cc List]
        Subject:     (the usual subject line)
        Server:      (Box name)

        Message Text starts here


   ================================================

The "Server" line may be left empty, in which case XP
either finds the correct server for the recipient or
sends it to your main server.

Note: If you send to a Newsgroup, it must also exist
in your newsgroup list, otherwise it will NOT be
sent.

To send Binary Files put in an extra line:

        To:  USER@ADDRESS, /NEWSGROUP or [cc List]
        Subject:     (the usual subject line)
        Server:      (Box name)
        File:    c:\path\file

For anything other than Fido File-Attaches, any text
entered in the body of the message is ignored and
will not be sent. If you do not enter the full path,
but only the name, the file must be in the SEND
directory, as defined under /Config/Paths.

For Fido File-Attaches you must use the .MSG ending,
otherwise the attach-file is deleted before the Fido
mailer can transfer it. For Fido it is obligatory to
enter the "server" line.

If you integrate an external program which sends
messages through the AUTOEXEC directory, then you
should set the AUTOEXEC switch in the set-up window
for either the /Config/Tools or the Config/Keys.
This runs the AUTOEXEC routine each time this program
is finished.

<<AUTOEXEC in Timing-Lists

You can put the command AUTOEXEC (also selectable
with <F2>) in a timing list, to run the AutoExec
routine at a fixed time.
<<It will also be run when the date changes.

START batch files will not be run in this case.

<<Notes
Order of events at CrossPoint start-up.

<< Command Line Parameters for starting CrossPoint

CrossPoint is started thus:

            XP [/Option1 /Option2 ...]

Options are:

   /?    Help

   /av:  Runs the integrated archive viewer.
         eg. XP /av:file.zip. Wild cards allowed.

   /f:<File>  loads a EGA/VGA-Font File (Screen Font)
              in the usual formats (8x8, 8x16 Pixels)
              If no ending given, .FNT assumed.

   /gd:  selects another phone charge file (Default:
         GEBUEHR.DAT).

   /j    no dumb remark when exiting CrossPoint....

   /k:X  Passes the (single) keystroke X to the
         program, whereby X is any character.
         (Can start a key macro on start-up)

   /l:X  selects the language, eg. /l:E for English.
         The language module must be installed.

   /LCD  changes colours to improve screen visibility
         on laptops etc.
         see also /m below.

   /m    Forces a black & white display.

   /maus   activates a  Cursor-Mouse emulation.

   /pw:xxx  passes the start-up password direct.

   /q    deactivates all sounds, so as not to
         wake you at night..

   /rp   Do not check TSRs
         CrossPoint normally checks after a
         DOS-Shell, whether TSRs were loaded, and
         exits if yes. (It is rarely advisable to
         load TSRs in a shell). However, if you must,
         this switch stops the check.

   /sd   Do not flush Smartdrive;
         Normally XP flushes the smartdrive write
         cache (if active) at regular intervals to
         minimise data loss possibilities. This
         deactivates this flushing if you don't like
         it.

   /trace   activates netcall script logging.

   /w    Give up CPU time under Windows. To lower the
         load on the CPU when XP is idle, the screen
         saver, the clock and the mouse emulation is
         switched off.

   /z:x  Set x screen lines. x must be one of the
         values shown under /Config/Display/Lines.

For the following options, if you set more than one,
they are carried out in the order shown here.
/ip & /ips may not be specified simultaneously.
In this case the LAST given is run.


   /autostart:hhmm-hhmm  Starts CrossPoint if the
        current time is in the given time period.
        This entry is designed for the autoexec.bat
        file and starting the PC with a time switch.
        If the time at start is in the given period,
        XP starts up.

   /user:BOX:NAME  sets the User name for the given
                   Box. For multi-user points.
                   For Fido use "_" instead of ":" in
                   the Box name.

   /ip:FILE   Imports the specified file name as
              puffer as under (/XPoint/Import
              /Puffer). The filename may be a full
              path; the file must have a PUFFER
              format.

   /ipe:FILE  as /ip, but sets the receive date for
              messages to the date they were
              written.

   /ips:BOX:FILE  reads in the puffer FILE, and also
                  lays it up ready to send to BOX.
                  For Fido use "_" instead of ":" in
                  the box name.

   /g  is an extra switch for /ip and /ipe, which
       sets the imported messages direct to "already
       read". Not necessary for /ips

   /n:BOX[:hh:mm]  starts CrossPoint making a call to
                   the given box. If the time is
                   specified, it waits to make a
                   netcall at the given time.
                   For Fido use "_" instead of ":" in
                   the box name.

   /n:*    starts CrossPoint to make a  /Netcall/All.

   /nr:BOX  makes a relogin netcall at the given box.
            The connect must already exist, and the
            box be waiting for "Username".
            (Z-Netz only)

   /t:n     starts CrossPoint running Timing List
            no. "n"

   /r       Does a Re-Org/Messages

   /pack    Does a Re-Org/Pack

   /xpack   Only pack files whose use lies under 100%
            A file name may be specified,
            eg. /xpack:USER packs only the User File.

   /ss  Start Screensaver

   /x   End Program. Since it is carried out last, it
        is used to end the program after other tasks
        have been carried out by other parameters,

<< Diagnostics Options

   /d   debug mode; displays more information during
        the progress of a netcall.

   /df:1  Shows the command call when an external
          program is called (icl. parameters).

   /df:2  Waits for a key to be pressed after an
          external program call.

Instead of specifying long parameter lines when
calling CrossPoint, you can list your favourite
parameters in files for the [AUTOEXEC] directory@4019

  þ Netcall vanished?  ERROR.LOG
If an error occurs during a netcall or some other
automatic function, CrossPoint shows the error
message for a few minutes then carries on. This
prevents a whole series of unrelated tasks being
aborted by one error. To enable tracking down the
errors, CrossPoint writes all error messages into a
file <<ERRORS.LOG>>, and often what action it took,
like renaming files for safety. Always look in this
file if you think something has gone wrong.

(Note: There are other useful LOG files too!)

Normally, especially according to the Zerberus
standard in Z-Netz, if a netcall goes wrong, both
sides should recognise this, delete what has been
transferred and keep each keep the original netcall
packets to re-send next time.

Unfortunately this is not 100% reliable. BiModem for
example has caused puffer loss.

Setting the (rename CALLED) switch under
/Config/Options/Netcall renames a received CALLED
file for safety even after an interrupted netcall.
So, if the data do not get sent again, you can try to
rescue something. It is also useful if something
(very rarely, eg., power cut) goes wrong after the
file has been correctly received, while being
imported.

<< Netcall automatic and Timing Lists.

Here is an example of a program list. Each line
represents one activity, and defines times when
it will be carried out.

 + 22:00-22:59  01.01.-31.12.  þþþþþþþ  NETCALL HIT
   22:20-23:59  01.01.-31.12.  þ þ þþ   NETCALL JOKL
 + 00:05-01:30  01.01.-31.12.  þ  þ     REORG
 + 01:45-01:46  01.01.-31.12.  þþþþþþþ  EXEC doit.bat
 + 03:00-03:00  10.12.-10.12.  þþþþþþþ  QUIT

The entries have the following meaning:
 + 22:00-22:59  01.01.-31.12.  þþþþþþþ  NETCALL HIT
 ³ ³            ³              ³        ³
 ³ ³            ³              ³        À Activity
 ³ ³            ³              À Weekdays (Mon-Sun)
 ³ ³            ÀÄÄ Dated period for the activity
 ³ ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ Time period
 ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄ + = shows it is active

The "+" means that the entry is active, ie. will be
carried out. Toggle active on and off with "A".

The first entry is the start and stop <<time>> for the
activity, ie. the period during which the activity
will be attempted. For example 10:00 to 11:59 for a
netcall will mean CrossPoint starts attempting a
netcall at 10:00, and if not successful, will give up
at 11:59.

If it is successful earlier, it stops anyway and does
no more in this period.

The end time may be before the start time, in which
case CrossPoint will make 2 activities out of it.
 "11:00-10:00" would be handled as:
 "00:00-10:00" and "11:00-23:59".

The next entry is a start and stop <<date>> for the
activity. The activity will not be attempted before
the start date or after the end date. During this
period, behavior will be regulated by the weekday
entry and the time-of-day entries.

Next is a pattern symbolising the weekdays you have
entered on which the activity should be carried out.

Finally the command is shown for the activity to be
carried out. The following commands are available:

<<NETCALL BOX>>  Netcall at "BOX"

<<REORG>>        Re-organise data bank
                 (as /Re-Org/Messages

<<PACK>>         Pack Data Bank
                 (as /Re-Org pack)

<<EXEC Prog.>>   Start Program or Batch file

<<END>>          Stop running the Timing List
<<QUIT>>         End the program
<<QUIT n>>       End the program with Errorlevel n
<<QUIT_ONCE>>    End the program, but only once in
                 the time period.
<<QUIT_ONCE n>>  ditto, but with Errorlevel n

<<AUTOEXEC>>     Action entries in the AUTOEXEC
                 directory.
<<CRASH z:n/n>>  Fido-Crash at node z:n/n
<<CRASHS>>       Do all waiting crashes
<<REQUESTS>>     Do all waiting File-Requests

<<UUCP File Lists for Fileservers.

Somehow you have to get to know the name under which
the file list for the fileserver needs to be
requested. When you know it, it is best entered
directly in /edit/systems in the index file box. Then
you can request it directly with
/Message/Fileserver/List/Request.

Otherwise order it with /Message/Fileserver/Request.
Enter the name of the list-file by hand.

The requested file should land in your
file-request directory. You can see the full name of
the file in the UUCP File Request Report, which XP
writes in your PM group.

Now you have to discover the format of the list.
There are the following possibilities:

<< Nodelists & Nodediffs (FIDO)

Fido still uses the addressing system that all FIDO
systems (yes, world wide!) are to be found in a huge
list, which is updated weekly. This list is called
the <<Nodelist>>, and contains details of each FIDO node
(name, place, sysop, tel.no., modem etc. etc.).

If you wish to communicate directly with FIDO boxes
You must have this list available, because the FIDO
point program (in this case CrossPoint), must check
against the nodelist before it makes contact.

(There are also programs for browsing this list, to
glean information from it, search for boxes, sysops
or whatever.)

At the beginning you will need to get the complete
list once.

This list is very large, and to save everybody having
to get it every week, each week only the
*differences* to the last list are transported, in a
much smaller file called a <<NODEDIFF>>. As long as you
get this each week without fail, CrossPoint can
update your NodeList to the latest level. But if you
miss one, the chain is broken and you have to get a
complete new list.

You can have your FIDO node (server) send you the
nodediff each week. They are always packed with ARC.

If you check the box "import diffs automatically"
under the menu /Fido/Options, CrossPoint will
recognise when a nodediff comes, and unpack it (make
sure ARC is available; see /Config/External/unpacker)
and import it automatically.

Otherwise it lands in the subdirectory for received
files, you must <<unpack it>> and import it by hand under
/Fido/Nodelist/Read Diff

Which week the NodeList (and the nodediff) is for is
shown in its filename extension.
