The playground directory is intended for new code files that
are not complete yet but may be interesting for other developers.
It is also useful for developing new concepts and making sure
no work is done twice.

If the code nears completion please move the respective file(s) out
of the playground directory (and remove their CVS logs). Be aware
the corresponding RCS files (the "Attic") in the repository may be
deleted, so don't rely on CVS history in this directory.

If you are not interested in seeing bleeding edge source, please delete
this directory. As long as you do no new cvs checkout or cvs update -d,
you won't be bothered by this directory again.
