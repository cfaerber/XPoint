* Changes between versions   -*- mode:indented-text; mode:outline-minor -*-

This file (NEWS) documents the significant changes between all
versions of nomarch, with the newest changes first.


* Changes in nomarch 1.4

Fixed a bug which could hang nomarch with corrupt files.


* Changes in nomarch 1.3

Added compression methods 5 and 6, which seem to be along the same
lines as v1.0 of the CP/M `crunch' scheme (so I was able to adapt some
code from lbrate). This isn't very well tested though - all I know is
that it works on the single method-6 test file I have - so if anyone
has any more files using these methods they can test it on (use
`nomarch -lv' to check the methods used by a file) I'd appreciate
feedback on whether it works or not. :-)

Self-extracting archives (for both MS-DOS and CP/M) can be read. (It
doesn't support those produced with pkpak, but even pkunpak can't read
those.)

Now supports the Acorn Archimedes's variant "Spark" format (including
the extra compression method), which is based on the more usual .arc.
Any `subdirectories' are extracted as the .arc files they really are.

main.c now uses unistd.h rather than getopt.h, which was troublesome
on some systems. Thanks to Geoff Gibbs for spotting this.


* Changes in nomarch 1.2

Added `-p' option, to extract files to standard output. Thanks to
Hilko Bengen for reminding me about this one.

Fixed DST-related bug which caused some file times to be wrong by an
hour.


* Changes in nomarch 1.1

New `-U' option, to use uppercase archive member filenames - or more
precisely, to avoid lowercasing them. (In practice, almost all
archives use uppercase member filenames.)

File-writing errors didn't previously cause a non-zero exit value -
they do now.

Fixed memory leak when not all of an archive file member could be
read.

Added section on how to use nomarch with Emacs to man page.
