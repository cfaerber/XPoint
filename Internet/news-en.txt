2001-03-24: OpenXP/32 finally GPL'd!
As announced, OpenXP/32 is available under GPL from now on. This means that it does not have to be registered at all now
and in future.
<br />Some changes have also been made. The Fido mailer supports BinkP protocol directly now (Win32 version only). ZConnect
works again. Integration of UUCP is being worked on.
<br />Although it is too soon to release a new beta, you may test OpenXP/32 by using a snapshot. Be sure to backup your data before!
Please read the FAQs.

2001-02-26: OpenXP/32 GPL things...
The original XP sources have been made available under GPL. Our thanks
go to everybody who made this possible, especially Peter Mandrella.
We are currently working on getting rid of non-GPL code. As soon as
this has been done, OpenXP32 will not have to be registered anymore.

2001-02-05: New website is online!
