<h2>Notes on OpenXP 3.70</h2>

OpenXP 3.70 is <b>beta</b>. Some features of other versions have been
disabled since they have not been ported yet.

<h3>Advances of this version?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Dos,Win,OS/2 and Linux/FreeBSD port
<li>by using 32 bit some limitations are gone
</ul>

<h3>Be aware:</h3>
<ul>
<li>With Win9x/ME the win32 version runs very slow since terminal
support of these windows versions is bad. Use OpenXP dos instead.
But, on WinNT/2000 the win32 version is much faster than the dos
version.
<li>BBS support has been disabled except for FidoNet. The fido
mailer does currently not work under win32. Use the dos version
instead. Charge calculation does not work.
</ul>

<h3>This version will provide in future:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Usage of remote modems via TCP
</ul>
