<h2>Information on OpenXP</h2>

Crosspoint (XP) is a text-based mailer for various bbs nets like
FidoNet, ZConnect and of course internet mail and news. In December 1999
the writer of Crosspoint, Peter Mandrella, released
Crosspoint 3.20&szlig; sources to the public.

<br>Since then many people worked on these sources - OpenXP has been
born.

<p>There are three versions of OpenXP:

<p><a href="log320.html">OpenXP 3.20</a>, basically Peter's Crosspoint
3.20&szlig; with some bugfixes. Only further bugfixes are applied to
this version. No new features will be added.

<p><a href="oxp330-e.html">OpenXP 3.30</a>, 16 bit, under development.
Bigger changes.

<p><a href="oxp370-e.html">OpenXP 3.70</a>, purely 32 bit, there have
been many changes. Also a native Windows, OS/2 and Linux/FreeBSD version
exists. When developing this version, some features have been disabled
as porting a 16 bit program to 32 bit and different platforms cannot
be done in one step. This version is "work in progress".

<p>There is a <a href="xp-faq.html">FAQ</a> concerning the different
versions of xXPx.
