<h2>Information on OpenXP</h2>

Crosspoint (XP) is a text-based Mailer for various mailbox nets like
FidoNet, ZConnect and of course Internet Mail and News. In December 1999
Crosspoint writer Peter Mandrella released Crosspoint 3.20&szlig; sources.

<br>Meanwhile many people worked on these sources and OpenXP has been
created.

<p>OpenXP exists in three versions:

<p><a href="eoxp320.html">OpenXP 3.20</a>, basically Peter's Crosspoint
3.20&szlig; with some bugfixes. Only further bugfixes are applied to
this version. No new features will be added.

<p><a href="eoxp330.html">OpenXP 3.30</a>, 16 bit, under development.
Bigger changes.

<p><a href="eoxp370.html">OpenXP 3.70</a>, purely 32 bit, has been
changed much. Exists also in a native Windows, OS/2 and Linux/FreeBSD
version. When developing this version, some features have been disabled
as porting a 16 bit program to 32 bit and different platforms cannot
be done in one step. This version is "work in progress".
