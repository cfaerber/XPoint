<p>Crosspoint (XP) is a text-based mailer for various BBS nets like
FidoNet, ZConnect and of course internet mail and news. In December 1999
the author of Crosspoint, Peter Mandrella, released Crosspoint 3.20&szlig;
sources to the public.

<br>Since then many people worked on these sources - OpenXP has been
born.

<p>There are two OpenXP branches:

<p><b>OpenXP 3.40</b>, 16 bit, many changes have been made compared to
the original XP 3.20&szlig;.

<p><b>OpenXP 3.70</b>, 32 bit. Native Windows, OS/2 and Linux/FreeBSD
versions (for information on the latter see
<a href="http://www.linux.openxp.de">here</a>) are available. When
developing this version, some features have been disabled as porting
a 16 bit program to 32 bit and different platforms cannot be done
in one step. This version is "work in progress".

have to register them. OpenXP 3.70 will be available under the GPL as
soon as Peter releases GPL XP sources officially.
