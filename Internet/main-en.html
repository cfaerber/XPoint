<p>Crosspoint (XP) is a text-based mailer for various bbs nets like
FidoNet, ZConnect and of course internet mail and news. In December 1999
the writer of Crosspoint, Peter Mandrella, released Crosspoint 3.20&szlig;
sources to the public.

<br>Since then many people worked on these sources - OpenXP has been
born.

<p>There are three versions of OpenXP:

<p><b>OpenXP 3.20</b>, basically Peter's Crosspoint
3.20&szlig; with some bugfixes. Only further bugfixes are applied to
this version. No new features will be added.

<p><b>OpenXP 3.40</b>, 16 bit, bigger changes.

<p><b>OpenXP 3.70</b>, purely 32 bit, there have
been many changes. Native Windows, OS/2 and Linux/FreeBSD versions
are available. When developing this version, some features have been disabled
as porting a 16 bit program to 32 bit and different platforms cannot
be done in one step. This version is "work in progress".
