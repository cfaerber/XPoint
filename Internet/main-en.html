<p>CrossPoint (XP) is a text-based mailer for various BBS nets like FidoNet, Z-Net and MausNet as well as Internet mail and news. In December 1999 the author of CrossPoint, Peter Mandrella, released CrossPoint 3.20&szlig; sources to the public.
<br />
Since then many people worked on these sources - OpenXP has been born.</p>

<p>There are two OpenXP branches:</p>

<p><b>OpenXP 3.40</b>, 16 bit, many improvements have been made, see feature list below.</p>

<p><b>OpenXP 3.70</b>, 32 bit. Native Windows, OS/2 and Linux/FreeBSD versions (for information on the latter see <a href="http://www.linux.openxp.de">here</a>) are available. When developing this version, some features have been disabled as porting a 16 bit program to 32 bit and different platforms cannot be done in one step. This version is "work in progress".</p>
