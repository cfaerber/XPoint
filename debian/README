			OpenXP/32
			---------

The OpenXP packages have a special format (compatible with Debian
Policy):

   <upstream-version>-<debian-revision>[snapshot<date>]

<debian-revision> is ``0'' if there has not been a Debian release
for <upstream-version>.
The <date> part is *only* used for daily snapshots.

There are meta-packages you might want to install, which depend on
utilities often needed for certain network types (especially
archivers/compressors):

  openxp-tools-ftn	Tools for FidoNet/FTN support.
  openxp-tools-uucp	Tools for (built-in) UUCP support.
  openxp-tools-zconnect	Tools for ZConnect/Zerberus support.
